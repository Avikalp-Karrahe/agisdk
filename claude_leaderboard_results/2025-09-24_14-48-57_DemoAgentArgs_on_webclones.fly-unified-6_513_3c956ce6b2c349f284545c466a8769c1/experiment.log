Let me think about this step by step:

1) I need to book a flight from Austin to Pittsburgh on December 11th, 2024

2) Looking at the current page, I need to:
   - Select One-way since no return flight is requested
   - Enter Austin as the origin 
   - Enter Pittsburgh as the destination
   - Set the date
   - Keep 1 Adult traveler
   - Keep Economy class (Basic Economy will be selected later)

3) First step is to change from Roundtrip to One-way since it's a single flight

4) I can see the One-way radio button has bid "195" in the accessibility tree

Let me click the One-way radio button:

```click("195")```

Let me think about the next step:

1) The One-way option is now selected

2) Next, I need to enter the origin city (Austin) into the Origin field

3) Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see the origin combobox with bid "221"

4) I'll fill in "Austin" as the origin city:

```fill("221", "Austin")```

This action will populate the origin field with Austin, which is the departure city for this flight booking. After this, we'll need to enter the destination (Pittsburgh), set the date, and proceed with finding flights.

3) Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see the destination combobox has bid "241"

4) According to the Current page state, this combobox is currently empty and needs the destination city filled in

Let me fill in Pittsburgh as the destination:

```fill("241", "Pittsburgh")```

This will enter Pittsburgh into the destination field. After this, we'll need to:
- Set the departure date to December 11th, 2024
- Find available flights

Let me analyze the situation:

1) The last action resulted in an error because the date field (bid "395") appears to be readonly and not directly editable

2) Looking at the current page:
- The date field is likely a datepicker that needs to be clicked first to open the calendar interface
- The field has bid "395" and is labeled "Depart"

3) Instead of trying to fill the date directly, I should:
- Click on the date field first to open the datepicker
- This should allow us to select the date through the calendar interface

Let me click on the date field to open the datepicker:

```click("395")```

This should open up the calendar interface where we can then select December 11th, 2024. After this, we'll be able to proceed with finding flights, selecting Basic Economy, and choosing an aisle seat.

2) Looking at the current state:
- Currently showing September and October 2025
- Need to navigate to December 2024
- There's a combobox for month (bid "427") and year (bid "441")

3) Since we need to get to December 2024:
- We need to change the year first from 2025 to 2024
- Then we can change the month to December

4) Looking at the accessibility tree, the year combobox (bid "441") has options including 2024

Let me select 2024 in the year combobox:

```select_option("441", "2024")```

After this, we'll need to:
- Change the month to December
- Select the 11th day
- Click Find flights
- Select Basic Economy
- Choose an aisle seat

4) Need to select "December" from this combobox before we can select the specific date (11th)

Let me select December in the month combobox:

```select_option("427", "December")```

This will change the calendar view to December 2024, after which we can select the 11th day, click Find flights, select Basic Economy, and choose an aisle seat.

2) However, I notice from the current page state that:
- The origin field shows an error "Please enter a valid origin"

3) This suggests that:
- The city names need to be selected from a dropdown list
- Simply typing the city names wasn't sufficient
- We need to click on the combobox and select from available options

4) Let's start with the origin field:
- The origin combobox has bid "221"
- We should try again with the full airport code/name format

Let me fill the origin field with more specific information:

```fill("221", "AUS - Austin International")```

After this, we'll need to:
- Select the correct option from the dropdown
- Enter Pittsburgh with its airport code
- Complete the search process
- Select Basic Economy

2) Looking at the current state:

- We might need to wait for dropdown suggestions to appear and select from them

3) Let's try a simpler approach:
- Start with just the airport code "AUS" in the origin field
- Wait for the dropdown to show
- Select the correct option from there

4) Let me first clear and then fill the origin field with just "AUS":

```fill("221", "AUS")```

After this, we should:
- Wait for dropdown suggestions
- Select Austin from the suggestions
- Repeat the process for Pittsburgh
- Then proceed with finding flights

Let me analyze the current situation:

1) Looking at the current page state:
- We successfully completed the search and can see available flights
- Two flights are displayed:
  * 8:00 AM - 5:39 PM (9h 39m, 1 stop)
  * 2:00 PM - 10:58 PM (8h 58m, 1 stop)
- Different fare classes are shown: Basic Economy, Economy, Premium Economy, Business, First

2) Our goal requires:
- Basic Economy class
- The 8:00 AM flight (matches requested departure time)
- Need to select Basic Economy fare for $165

3) Looking at the accessibility tree:
- The Basic Economy fare button for the 8:00 AM flight has bid "971"
- This matches our requirements for:
  * Basic Economy class
  * 8:00 AM departure time
  * Price of $165

4) Next logical step:
- Click on the Basic Economy fare button for the 8:00 AM flight
- This will let us proceed to seat selection for Alice Brown's aisle seat preference

Let me select the Basic Economy fare for the 8:00 AM flight:

```click("971")```

This will select the appropriate fare class and flight. After this, we'll:
- Choose an aisle seat
- Enter Alice Brown's passenger information
- Complete payment with the provided credit card

Let me think about the error and next step carefully:

1) The error message indicates my previous action attempt with select_option was not in the correct format

2) Looking at the current state:
- We have entered Alice's first and last name
- Need to enter birth date: 5/20/1992
- Looking at the accessibility tree, I see the Month field (bid "1196")
- The month combobox requires value "05" for May

3) I'll correct my previous attempt by:
- Using the proper format for month selection
- Using the numeric value "05" instead of "May"
- Keeping the bid "1196" for the month combobox

Let me select the correct month format:

```select_option("1196", "05")```

After this succeeds, we'll:
- Enter the day (20)
- Enter the year (1992)

Let me think about the error and next step carefully:

1) I received an error because I tried to format the month value in my select_option action. I should just pass the month value directly.

2) Looking at the current state:
- We have entered Alice's first and last name
- Need to enter birth date: 5/20/1992
- Looking at the accessibility tree, I see the Month field (bid "1196")

3) Let me try a simpler approach:
- Use select_option with just the month number
- Keep the bid "1196"
- No extra formatting

```select_option("1196", "5")```

Let me think about this error and the next step carefully:

1) The error indicates that I'm trying to use select_option on an element that isn't a standard <select> element
- It's actually a MuiSelect component (Material-UI)
- These typically need to be clicked first to open the dropdown, then the option can be selected

2) Looking at the current state:
- We have Alice's first and last name entered
- We're trying to enter birth date: 5/20/1992
- The month field (bid "1196") needs to be clicked first to show the options
- Then we can select the month from the dropdown that appears

3) The correct approach should be:
- First click on the month field to open the dropdown
- This will show us the list of months to select from

4) Let me click on the month combobox to open it:

```click("1196")```

After this:
- The month dropdown should appear
- We can select May (5)
- Then enter day (20) and year (1992)
- Select gender (Female)
- Choose an aisle seat
- Complete payment information

Let me think about this step-by-step:

1) Looking at my previous attempts and errors:
- I tried several approaches to fill in the date of birth
- Got an error for trying to include multiple actions in one response
- Need to focus on one single action at a time

2) Current status:
- We have Alice's first and last name entered
- We're trying to enter birth date: 5/20/1992
- The month combobox needs to be handled first

3) Looking at the accessibility tree again:
- The month combobox has bid "1196"
- It's a combobox component that likely needs to be clicked first

4) Next single action:
- Click on the month combobox to open the dropdown
- Just this one action, nothing else
- After it opens, we can select the month in the next step

```click("1196")```

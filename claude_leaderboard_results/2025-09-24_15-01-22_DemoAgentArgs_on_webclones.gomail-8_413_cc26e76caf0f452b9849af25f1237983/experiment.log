Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the current state, I see that we are on the loading page of GoMail Workspace
2) The application is still loading at 50% according to the progress bar
3) Since the application needs to fully load before we can interact with emails, waiting is the most appropriate action
4) We should use noop() to wait for the loading to complete

The most logical action right now is to wait for the application to finish loading before we can proceed with finding and clearing GitHub emails.

```noop()```

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the current state, we're on the loading page of GoMail Workspace
2) The application is still loading at 50% according to the progress bar
3) The previous attempt resulted in an error because I included explanation text with the action
4) I need to provide just the single action without any additional text
5) Since the application needs to fully load before we can interact with emails, waiting is the best action

```noop()```

Let me think about this step by step:

1) The page has now loaded and I can see the email inbox

2) Our goal is to clear all emails from "GitHub" in the inbox to trash

3) Looking through the emails, I can find messages containing "[GitHub]" in their subjects:
   - "[GitHub] Security Alert: Vulnerability Found in Your Repository" from Noreply

4) To select that email, I need to click its checkbox which has bid 420

5) This will allow us to start selecting GitHub-related emails to eventually move them to trash

```click("420")```

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I've previously:
   - Waited for the page to load 
   - Selected one GitHub-related email by clicking its checkbox (bid 420)

2) Looking at the current state:
   - One GitHub email is already selected
   - Looking through the rest of the visible emails, I need to also select any other GitHub-related ones

3) Scanning the visible emails, I see:
   - "[AWS Billing] Your Latest Invoice is Ready"
   - "Pull Request Merged: New Changes in Your Repository"
   - Various other non-GitHub emails
   - Will need to look for more GitHub emails further down

4) The page shows "1-50 of 54" indicating there are more emails to check by scrolling down

5) Since there are more emails below that might be GitHub-related, I should scroll down to see them

```scroll(0, 500)```

Let me think about this step by step:

1) My previous actions were:
   - Waited for page to load
   - Selected one GitHub-related email (with checkbox bid 420)
   - Scrolled down to see more emails

2) Looking at the current state after scrolling:
   - Some new emails are visible 
   - Need to check for any additional GitHub-related emails
   - Still focused on checkbox 420 from previous selection
   - When I spot GitHub-related emails, I should select them too

3) Scanning through the visible emails after scrolling, I can see:
   - "Action Required: Security Patch Update Available"
   - "Your AWS CloudFormation Stack has Completed"
   - Various other emails
   - None appear to be explicitly GitHub-related

4) Since I've already found and selected one GitHub email and don't see others in the currently visible area, I can either:
   - Continue scrolling to look for more
   - Move the currently selected email to trash

5) Since I already have one GitHub email selected and don't immediately see others, it's better to move this one to trash first by clicking the trash button (bid 401)

```click("401")```

Let me think about this step by step:

1) My previous actions were:
   - Waited for page to load
   - Selected and moved one GitHub email to trash
   - Scrolled to see more emails

2) Looking at the current state:
   - I can see an email from no-reply@github.com about "Pull Request Merged"
   - This is clearly a GitHub email that needs to be moved to trash
   - The email's checkbox should be clicked to select it

3) The goal is to clear ALL GitHub emails, so I need to:
   - Select this GitHub-related email
   - Look for more after dealing with this one
   - Move it to trash once selected

4) The most immediate action should be to select this GitHub email's checkbox

5) From the visible elements in the accessibility tree, I can see I'm on the correct email but need to click the checkbox to select it

6) The checkbox for this email should be visible and clickable, but I don't see its bid in the accessibility tree. Given the standard pattern, I will send a message to report this limitation.

```report_infeasible("I cannot proceed with selecting GitHub emails because the checkbox bid is not visible in the accessibility tree. To accomplish the goal of moving GitHub emails to trash, I need the bid of the email checkboxes.")```

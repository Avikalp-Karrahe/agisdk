Let me think about how to achieve the goal step by step:

1) I need to order a Medium Pepperoni Pizza from Papa Johns Pizza

2) Looking at the current page, I can see Papa Johns Pizza is listed in the "National favorites" section with:
- Rating: 4.4
- Distance: 0.9 mi
- Time: 32 min
- $0 delivery fee, first order
- Has a promotion "15% off, up to $5"

3) To access their menu and order the pizza, I need to first click on Papa Johns Pizza.
The image/heading has bid 1418/1420.

4) Looking at the accessibility tree, I will click on the heading with bid 1420 to navigate to the restaurant page.

```click("1420")```

Let me click this and see what the next page shows so I can proceed with ordering the medium pepperoni pizza.

Looking at the current page state after clicking into Papa Johns Pizza, I can see we're now on their restaurant page. Let me analyze the best next action:

1) I can see some menu items including "Pepperoni Pizza" as one of their "Most Liked Items" which shows:
- Price: $19.18
- 88% liked (34 ratings)
- #1 Most Liked
- Has an "Add" button with bid 355

2) Since my goal is to add a Medium Pepperoni Pizza to cart, this appears to be the right item, though I'll note it doesn't explicitly specify the size in the listing.

3) The logical next step would be to click the "Add" button for the Pepperoni Pizza to add it to cart.

```click("355")```

This should either add the pizza directly to cart or open a customization modal where I can select the medium size. Let's see what happens after clicking the Add button.

Let me think about the current state and next best action:

1) After clicking the "Add" button for the Pepperoni Pizza, I can see we're now on a customization modal/page where I can:
- Select the pizza size
- Add preferences
- Choose quantity
- Add to cart

2) Looking at the accessibility tree, I notice the pizza is currently set to "Large" size, but my goal specifically requires a "Medium" pizza. I need to change this.

3) In the radiogroup for size selection, I can see:
- Small • 230 cal
- Medium • 320 cal • +$0.90
- Large • 480 cal • +$1.60 (currently selected)

4) To select the Medium size, I need to click the radio button with bid 702 based on the accessibility tree.

```click("702")```

This should change the size selection to Medium, and then I can proceed with adding it to the cart.

Let me think about the current state and next best action:

1) I've successfully selected the Medium size for the Pepperoni Pizza. Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see:
- The Medium size radio button (bid 702) is now checked=true
- The price shown on the Add to cart button is $20.08
- There's an "Add to cart" button with bid 739

2) My goal is to add this Medium Pepperoni Pizza to the cart and purchase it. The next logical step is to click the "Add to cart" button.

3) This should add the pizza with my selected customizations (Medium size) to the shopping cart.

```click("739")```

This should add the pizza to the cart, and then I can proceed with the checkout process to complete the purchase.

Let me analyze the current state and determine the next best action:

1) After adding the Medium Pepperoni Pizza to cart, I can see in the accessibility tree that there's a cart tooltip showing:
- Papa Johns Pizza 1 items
- Pepperoni Pizza 1 x $20.08
- Two buttons: "Go to Cart" (bid 753) and "Continue" (bid 755)
- Total before taxes: $26.07

2) Since my goal is to purchase the pizza, I need to proceed to checkout. The "Go to Cart" button will take me to the cart page where I can complete the purchase.

3) Looking at bid 753, the "Go to Cart" button is available to click.

Therefore, I will click the "Go to Cart" button to proceed with the purchase:

```click("753")```

This should take me to the cart page where I can review the order and proceed with checkout.

Let me think about this carefully:

1) I got an error trying to click bid "753" for the "Go to Cart" button, meaning this element doesn't actually exist in the current page accessibility tree.

2) Looking back at the current page's accessibility tree, I can see a cart/checkout icon with "1" indicator in the top navigation bar with bid "57".

3) Since I wasn't able to find the "Go to Cart" button directly, clicking this cart icon should be the alternative way to access the cart and proceed with checkout.

4) Given the structure shown in the accessibility tree:
```
[57] button '1'
```
This appears to be the cart button with a count of 1 item.

Therefore, I will click the cart button to access my cart and continue with the purchase:

```click("57")```

This should take us to the cart page where we can proceed with checkout.

Let me think about the current state and next best action:

1) Looking at the current accessibility tree, we're now on the cart page that shows:
- "Your cart from Papa Johns Pizza" heading
- A Medium Pepperoni Pizza for $20.08
- Quantity: 1x
- A "Checkout $26.07" button with bid 768

2) My goal is to purchase this Medium Pepperoni Pizza, and since I've successfully:
- Added the correct pizza to cart
- Confirmed it's the right size (Medium)
- Verified the price

3) The final step is to complete the purchase by clicking the checkout button which will take me to payment processing.

4) In the accessibility tree, I can see the checkout button:
```
[768] button 'Checkout $26.07'
```

Therefore, I will click the checkout button to proceed with the purchase:

```click("768")```

This should take us to the payment/checkout page to complete the purchase.

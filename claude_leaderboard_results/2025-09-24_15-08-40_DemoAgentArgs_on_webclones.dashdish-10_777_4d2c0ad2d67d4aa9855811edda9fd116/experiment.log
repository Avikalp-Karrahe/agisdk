Let me think about this step by step:

1) My goal is to place an order from "Souvla" for two items:
   - Medium Classic Cheeseburger
   - Small Bacon Double Cheeseburger
   With Standard Delivery

2) Looking at the current page state:
   - I'm on the main page of DashDish
   - I can see Souvla listed multiple times in various sections
   - One instance is in "The Infatuation's picks" section with:
     - 4.8 rating
     - 0.3 mi away
     - 28 min delivery time
     - Free delivery for first order

3) The first step would be to click on Souvla to view their menu and available items.
   I see the restaurant heading 'Souvla' with bid [974]

4) Therefore, my next action should be to click on the Souvla restaurant entry to access their menu.

```click("974")```

Note: This will allow me to view Souvla's menu where I can then locate and select the specific burger items requested.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the current state, I see I'm on Souvla's restaurant page that shows:
   - Their menu including the "Most Liked Items"
   - The Classic Cheeseburger ($13.11)
   - The Bacon Double Cheeseburger ($11.65)

2) Both items I need are actually listed in the Most Liked Items section:
   - Classic Cheeseburger is #1 Most Liked
   - Bacon Double Cheeseburger is #2 Most Liked

3) Each item has an "Add" button associated with it:
   - Classic Cheeseburger's Add button has bid [355]
   - Bacon Double Cheeseburger's Add button has bid [367]

4) The first step would be to add one of the items to the cart. Let's start with the Classic Cheeseburger.

```click("355")```

This will add the Classic Cheeseburger to the cart, and then I can proceed with adding the Bacon Double Cheeseburger next.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Currently I'm looking at the Classic Cheeseburger customization modal where I need to:
   - Select Medium size (the goal specifies Medium Classic Cheeseburger)
   - The size options are:
     * Small • 230 cal
     * Medium • 320 cal • +$0.90
     * Large • 480 cal • +$1.60 (currently selected)

2) I need to change the size from Large to Medium, which corresponds to the radio button with bid [702]

3) After selecting the correct size, I can click the "Add to cart" button to proceed with ordering the Bacon Double Cheeseburger next.

Therefore, I should first select the Medium size option:

```click("702")```

This will change the size to Medium, and then I can proceed with adding it to the cart.

1) I'm currently on the Classic Cheeseburger customization modal where:
   - I've successfully selected the Medium size
   - No other customizations are required per the goal
   - The "Add to cart" button is visible with bid [739]

2) Looking at my goal:
   - I still need to add the Small Bacon Double Cheeseburger
   - The next logical step is to add this first item to the cart

3) The "Add to cart" button shows the price ($14.01) and is ready to be clicked:
   - Button bid is [739]
   - This will add the Medium Classic Cheeseburger to the cart

Therefore, I should click the "Add to cart" button to proceed:

```click("739")```

This will add the Medium Classic Cheeseburger to the cart, after which I can proceed to add the Small Bacon Double Cheeseburger.

   - My last action trying to click "Go to Cart" with bid "832" failed

2) Looking at the current state:

   - The cart button appears to be shown as an icon with a number indicator
   - Looking at the accessibility tree, I see a button with "2" (bid [57])

3) Analysis:
   - The cart button appears to have a different bid than expected
   - The button showing "2" (indicating 2 items) is likely the cart button
   - This should take us to the checkout where we can select Standard Delivery

Therefore, I should click the cart button with the "2" indicator:

```click("57")```

This should take us to the cart/checkout page where we can proceed with Standard Delivery selection.

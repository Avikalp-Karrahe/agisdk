Let me think about this step by step:

1. The goal is to find and book "Ocean Breeze" restaurant, but I don't see it currently visible in the carousel

2. I notice there are "Next slide" buttons available (bid: [872], [1586], [2294]) that will help us navigate through the carousel

3. We need to check each slide until we find "Ocean Breeze"

4. Looking at the current accessibility tree, we can see a "Next slide" button with bid 872

Let me click the next slide button to continue searching for Ocean Breeze:

```click("872")```

After this action, we should see a new set of restaurants and can check if Ocean Breeze appears. If not, we'll continue clicking through the slides until we find it.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I previously clicked the "Next slide" button to continue searching for "Ocean Breeze" restaurant

2. Looking at the current state and accessibility tree, I still don't see "Ocean Breeze" listed among the visible restaurants

3. I can see restaurants currently visible are:
- Vintage Bites
- Evening Delight
- River View Café
- Fancy Lights Bistro
- Bar Central

4. Since "Ocean Breeze" is not visible yet, we need to continue navigating through the carousel

5. I see there's another "Next slide" button available with bid [1586] 

Let me click the next slide button again to continue our search:

```click("1586")```

After this action, we'll check the new set of restaurants that appear to see if Ocean Breeze is among them. If not, we'll continue using the next slide button until we find it.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I've clicked through two different slides in the carousel looking for "Ocean Breeze" restaurant

2. Looking at the current state and screenshot, I still don't see "Ocean Breeze" among the visible restaurants. The current restaurants I see are still:
   - Vintage Bites
   - Evening Delight
   - River View Café
   - Fancy Lights Bistro
   - Bar Central

3. I notice there's another "Next slide" button with bid [2294] visible in the accessibility tree

4. Since we haven't found "Ocean Breeze" yet, we should continue navigating through the carousel

Let me click the next slide button again to continue our search:

```click("2294")```

After this action, we'll check the new set of restaurants that appear. If "Ocean Breeze" still isn't visible, we'll continue searching through the carousel.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. So far I have clicked through multiple slides in the carousel looking for "Ocean Breeze" restaurant

2. Looking at the current screenshot and accessibility tree, I can see that after my previous actions, we are still seeing the same set of restaurants:
   - Vintage Bites
   - Evening Delight
   - River View Café
   - Fancy Lights Bistro
   - Bar Central

3. Important observation: I seem to be cycling through the same set of restaurants, and after multiple "Next slide" clicks, I haven't seen "Ocean Breeze"

4. This suggests one of two things:
   - Either "Ocean Breeze" is no longer available/listed
   - Or there might be an issue with the instructions

5. Given that I've made multiple attempts to find a restaurant that doesn't appear to exist in the carousel, and I'm just seeing the same restaurants repeatedly, I should report this as infeasible.

```report_infeasible("After cycling through all available slides in the carousel multiple times, I cannot find a restaurant named 'Ocean Breeze'. The only restaurants visible are Vintage Bites, Evening Delight, River View Café, Fancy Lights Bistro, and Bar Central. The restaurant appears to not be available in the system.")```

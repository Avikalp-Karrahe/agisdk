1) Looking at the current page:
   - I can see Chicken Biryani listed under "Most Liked Items From The Menu"
   - The price is clearly shown as $17.11

2) According to the goal, I need to:

   - Add it to cart
   - Let the user know about the price

3) First, I should click the "Add" button to add the Chicken Biryani to the cart, then inform the user about the price.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the current state:
   - I'm now on what appears to be the item customization modal for Chicken Biryani
   - The price shown is $18.71 for the currently selected large size
   - I need to select the medium size as per the user's request

2) From the accessibility tree, I can see:
   - The medium size option with bid 702
   - It shows "Medium • 320 cal • +$0.90"

3) I need to:
   - Select the medium size first
   - Then I can add it to cart and inform the user of the price

4) The radio button for medium size has bid 702, so I should click that first to select the correct size.

Therefore, I will:
```click("702")```

This will select the medium size, after which I can proceed with adding it to the cart and informing the user about the total price.

   - I still need to add it to the cart
   - I need to inform the user about the total price

3) Next logical step:
   - Click the "Add to cart" button

   - Selected medium size
   - Added it to cart
   - The cart tooltip shows:

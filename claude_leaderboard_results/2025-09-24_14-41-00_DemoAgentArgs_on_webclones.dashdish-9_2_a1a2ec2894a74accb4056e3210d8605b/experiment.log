Let me think about this step by step:

1. My goal is to add a "Large Classic Cheeseburger" from "RT Rotisserie" to the cart, then remove it.

2. Looking at the current state of the page:
   - I can see "RT Rotisserie" appears multiple times in the restaurant listings
   - Their rating is 4.8 and they are only 500 ft away with a 27 min delivery time
   - I need to first click on RT Rotisserie to access their menu

3. I can find RT Rotisserie in multiple sections, but I'll click on the most prominent one in the "Best of lunch" section where it has bid 820 for the image.

4. This will take me to their menu page where I can then look for the Large Classic Cheeseburger.

Therefore, I will:
```click("820")```

The click should take me to RT Rotisserie's menu page where I can proceed with finding and adding the specific item.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Looking at the current page, I'm now on RT Rotisserie's store page.

2. I need to find and add the "Classic Cheeseburger" to the cart.

3. Scanning through the page, I can see the "Classic Cheeseburger" listed under "Most Liked Items From The Menu" with these details:
   - Price: $11.89
   - 84% liked (32 ratings)
   - #1 Most Liked item
   - Has an "Add" button with bid 355

4. To add this item to the cart, I need to click the Add button.

Therefore, I will:
```click("355")```

This should add the Classic Cheeseburger to my cart. Once confirmed, I can proceed with removing it as per the goal.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Looking at the current state, I'm now in a modal window for the Classic Cheeseburger where I need to:
   - Select the size
   - Add it to cart
   - Then remove it (as per the final goal)

2. I can see that:
   - "Large • 480 cal • +$1.60" is already selected (radio button with bid 710 is checked)
   - There's an "Add to cart $13.49" button with bid 739

3. Since the Large size is already selected (which is what we want), I can proceed directly to adding it to the cart.

4. After clicking the "Add to cart" button, I'll be able to proceed with removing it from the cart.

Therefore, I will:
```click("739")```

This should add the Large Classic Cheeseburger to my cart, after which I can focus on removing it to complete the goal.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Current state of the page shows a modal/tooltip with:
   - RT Rotisserie heading
   - Classic Cheeseburger 1 x $13.49
   - "Go to Cart" button (bid 753)
   - "Continue" button (bid 755)

2. My goal is to remove the Large Classic Cheeseburger from the cart.

3. To remove the item, I first need to access the cart. Looking at the options available, I should click the "Go to Cart" button to access the cart where I can remove the item.

Therefore, I will:
```click("753")```

This will take me to the cart view where I should then be able to find an option to remove the item.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. My last action resulted in an error because I couldn't find the "Go to Cart" button with bid "753". This suggests that either:
   - The button has a different bid
   - Or the button isn't visible/present on the current page

2. Looking at the current page state and accessibility tree again:
   - I can see there's a cart icon with "1" displayed (bid 57)
   - This is likely the cart button I need to click to access my cart and remove the item

3. Since my goal is to remove the Large Classic Cheeseburger, I need to first access the cart, and clicking the cart button (bid 57) should take me there.

Therefore, I will:
```click("57")```

This should open the cart view where I can then find and remove the Classic Cheeseburger.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Looking at the current state:
   - I can see I'm now in the cart view
   - The Large Classic Cheeseburger is visible with price $13.49
   - There's a quantity of "1x" shown
   - There's a "-" button visible that would be used for removing items

2. Based on the accessibility tree:
   - The cart item controls are shown
   - I can see a button with bid "783" which appears to be the remove/minus button

3. My goal requires removing the Large Classic Cheeseburger, and clicking this button should decrement the quantity to 0, effectively removing it from the cart.

Therefore, I will:
```click("783")```

This should remove the Large Classic Cheeseburger from the cart, completing both parts of our goal (adding and then removing the item).

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Current state of the page shows:
   - A cart modal/view with "Your cart from" heading
   - A "Checkout $5.99" button (bid 768)
   - A close button (bid 765)

2. Reviewing my past actions:
   - I successfully added the Large Classic Cheeseburger
   - Tried to click on the remove button (bid 783)
   - Based on the current cart total of $5.99, it seems the item hasn't been removed yet

3. Looking at the accessibility tree, button bid 765 appears to be the close/remove button for the cart item.

4. Since my goal is to remove the Large Classic Cheeseburger and my previous attempt with bid 783 didn't work, I should try clicking the button with bid 765.

Therefore, I will:
```click("765")```

This should remove the item from the cart and complete our goal of adding and then removing the Large Classic Cheeseburger.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Reviewing what's happened so far:
   - I successfully added the Large Classic Cheeseburger to the cart
   - I accessed the cart view
   - My attempts to remove the item using bids "783" and "765" haven't worked, likely because I was looking at incorrect bid numbers

2. Looking at the current state of the page again:
   - There should be a quantity control or remove button for the cart item
   - I need to find the correct bid for the remove/minus button

3. Unfortunately, I'm unable to find the exact bid for the remove button in the accessibility tree. This suggests that either:
   - The interface has changed 
   - Or I don't have complete information about the cart view in the current state

4. In this case, I should:
```report_infeasible("I cannot complete the goal of removing the item from the cart because I cannot locate the correct button ID for removing items in the current cart view. The accessibility tree doesn't show the cart item removal controls.")```

1. I received an error when trying to fill in the date directly because the date input appears to be readonly (as shown in the error message)

2. Looking at the accessibility tree again:
- I see the date textbox with bid 402 is labeled "Depart"
- Given it's readonly, it likely needs to be clicked first to open a date picker

3. Let's first click the date field to open the date picker:

```click("402")```

After this action, I expect a date picker calendar to appear where we can select December 10th.

- I see a combobox for year selection with bid 448 to select 2023

3. Let's first change the month to December using the month combobox:

```select_option("434", "December")```

After this, I will need to:
- Change the year to 2023 
- Select December 10th from the calendar
- Click Find flights
- Check departure times to see if there's a flight before noon
- Book if there's a qualifying flight

2. This suggests my previous entries for Charlotte and Norfolk weren't properly selected
- The comboboxes likely require selecting from a dropdown list rather than just typing in the city names
- I should try entering Charlotte again and selecting it from the dropdown

3. Let me clear and re-enter Charlotte into the origin field:
- The origin combobox has bid 228

2. I need to enter Norfolk in a format that matches how Charlotte appears:
- Since Charlotte shows as "Charlotte, NC", Norfolk should probably be entered as "Norfolk, VA"
- This full format should help ensure proper selection from the dropdown

2. For the origin field (Charlotte):

- 8:53 AM - Economy fare $363
- 8:08 AM - Economy fare $283
- All other flights are after noon (12:37 PM, 1:38 PM, etc.)

3. Among the morning flights:
- 8:08 AM flight is the cheapest at $283 for Economy class
- This flight qualifies as it departs before noon
- Looking at the accessibility tree, the button to select this Economy fare has bid 1077

4. Since this is the cheapest morning flight:
- It meets our criteria (departs before noon)
- We should book this flight using the provided passenger information
- The Select Economy fare button shows '$283 Economy'

```click("1077")```

After this action, I expect to:
- Move to the passenger information page
- Be able to enter Sarah White's details
- Complete the booking with the provided payment information

Let me think step by step:

1. Current state analysis:
- Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see:
  - Both airports are set correctly (Charlotte CLT to Norfolk ORF)
  - The date is set to Dec 10
  - A flight is visible departing at 8:08 am to 10:19 am
  - The fare is $262.00 with $20.29 in taxes/fees, total $282.29

2. This flight perfectly matches our criteria:
- Departs before noon (8:08 am)
- It's the earliest and appears to be cheapest option
- Has all the flight details visible and ready to book

3. Looking at the traveler information section:
- I see text fields for Sarah White's information
- First name field is visible and required
- Let's start filling in her details with the first name

```fill("1418", "Sarah")```

After this action, I will need to:
- Fill in her last name
- Enter her date of birth (04/10/1990)
- Select her gender (Female)
- Enter remaining required information
- Then proceed with payment details

Let me think step by step:

1. Current state:
- Flight from Charlotte to Norfolk on Dec 10 is selected (8:08 am departure)
- Total price is $282.29
- I just filled in Sarah's first name
- Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see the last name field is required

2. Next required field:
- Last name textbox is visible with bid 1430
- It's marked as required in the accessibility tree
- We need to enter "White" based on the passenger information provided

3. Best next action:
- Fill in Sarah's last name "White" in the last name field
- This is a required field that must match her government ID exactly
- After this, we'll need to enter her date of birth and gender

```fill("1430", "White")```

After this action, I will need to:
- Enter her date of birth (04/10/1990) using the month, day, and year fields
- Select her gender (Female)
- Complete any remaining required passenger information
- Proceed with payment details

1. Current state:
- Flight is selected (8:08 am CLT to ORF, $282.29 total)

- The date of birth fields are visible in the accessibility tree:
  - Month combobox with bid 1456
  - Day textbox with bid 1467
  - Year textbox with bid 1475

2. Looking at Sarah's information:
- Her date of birth is 04/10/1990
- We need to fill in each part of the date separately
- The month combobox needs to be set to April (04)

3. Best next action:
- Select "April" from the month combobox (bid 1456)
- This is the first part of entering her complete birth date
- After this, we'll enter the day and year

```select_option("1456", "April")```

After this action, I will need to:
- Enter day (10) in the day field
- Enter year (1990) in the year field
- Select gender (Female)
- Complete any remaining required fields
- Proceed with payment information

Let me think step by step:

1. Current state analysis:
- Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see:
  - First name (Sarah) and last name (White) are entered
  - A flight departing at 8:08 am is shown at $262.00 + $20.29 taxes
  - The date of birth field appears with bid 1456 for the month selection

2. The previous error occurred because I tried to use select_option with a specific month value. Looking at the accessibility tree again:
- The month combobox (bid 1456) is showing a blank value ('⁠')
- Month selection needs to be made first for DOB

3. Best next action:
- Click the month combobox to open the dropdown
- This will let us see and select April for Sarah's birth month (04)
- After this opens, we can select the specific month

```click("1456")```

After this action, I expect the month dropdown to open, allowing us to then select April and continue with the rest of the date of birth information.

1. I need to notify the user about the flight I found:
- There is an 8:08 am flight from Charlotte to Norfolk
- This flight meets our criteria (before noon)
- The price is $262.00 + $20.29 in taxes = $282.29 total
- This appears to be the cheapest morning flight option

2. Since the goal asks me to both:
- Tell the user what time the flight departs
- Let them know whether I booked it or not

3. I will send this information to the user:

```send_msg_to_user("I found a flight departing at 8:08 am. I am now proceeding with booking it using the provided passenger information.")```

After this, I will continue with entering Sarah White's information in the booking form to complete the reservation.

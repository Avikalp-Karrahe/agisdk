Let me think about this step by step:

1) The goal is to assign specific color codes to two calendars:
   - "Personal" calendar should be sage colored
   - "Work" calendar should be peacock colored

2) Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see both calendars listed under "My calendars":
   - Work calendar is present with bid 126
   - Personal calendar is present with bid 143

3) However, I notice that there is no direct option to change calendar colors shown in the current state. I would need to:
   - First click on the calendar name or checkbox to bring up the color options
   - Then select the appropriate color

4) Let's start with the Work calendar by clicking on it first:

```click("126")```

This should bring up a menu or options panel where I can select the peacock color. After seeing the result of this action, I can proceed with selecting the color and then repeat the process for the Personal calendar.

Let me think about the next step:

1) I previously clicked on the Work calendar checkbox (bid 126), and now I need to check if there's access to color options.

2) Looking at the accessibility tree, I notice there's a "more options" button or menu associated with the Work calendar - indicated by bid 128 which is the text "Work" under the checkbox.

3) To change the color, I should first click on the calendar name/text to bring up the color settings menu:

```click("128")```

This should open a menu or dialog where I can select the peacock color. After this action, I'll wait to see what options become available for selecting the color.

Let me think about the next step:

1) After clicking on the "Work" calendar and its label, the next step would be to check if there's a color menu or options panel showing up.

2) Since I need to assign color codes to both the Work and Personal calendars, but I'm not seeing direct color options in the current accessibility tree, it suggests that either:
   - I need to select a different element
   - Or there might be a different approach to access calendar settings

3) Looking at the structure again, I notice each calendar has an icon/button with more options (bid "126" for Work checkbox).

4) Let me try to click the "More" button or ellipsis associated with the Work calendar to see if that reveals the color options:

```click("126")```

After this action, I expect to see a menu with calendar settings including color options. I'll wait to see what options become available before proceeding with selecting the peacock color.

Let me think about the current situation:

1) I've tried clicking on different elements associated with the Work calendar, but haven't seen direct color options appear in the accessibility tree.

2) Looking at the structure again, I notice there's a "more options" button icon represented by bid "529" and a vertical dots icon "⋮" next to the Work calendar label.

3) However, since I don't see this bid in the current accessibility tree, I'll look for another way to access calendar settings.

4) I notice that there's another more menu icon directly on the Work calendar text entry (bid "128") which appears to be the actual interactive element.

Let me click on this more menu icon for Work calendar:

```click("530")```

After this action, I should see a menu appear with calendar settings including color options. If this bid is not valid or doesn't produce the desired result, I'll need to look for alternative approaches to access the calendar color settings.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I've encountered several errors trying to access the color settings through various clicks. The TimeoutError suggests the elements I tried to click were either not accessible or not the correct ones.

2) Looking back at the accessibility tree, I notice that each calendar has a kebab menu/more options button indicated by bid "132" (next to Work calendar) that I haven't tried yet.

3) The Work calendar checkbox has a specific "more" button (shown with bid "124") which looks like a more reliable way to access settings.

4) In the accessibility tree, I can see:
   ```
   [124] LabelText ''
      [126] checkbox 'Select calendar Work Work', focused, checked='false'
      [128] paragraph ''
         StaticText 'Work'
   ```

Let me try clicking on the 3-dots/more menu icon associated with the Work calendar:

```click("124")```

This should open up a context menu with calendar settings including color options. After seeing what appears, I can then select the appropriate color option for the Work calendar.

Let me analyze the current situation:

1) I've been trying to find a way to change calendar colors but encountering difficulties finding the correct element to click.

2) Looking at my past actions and errors, direct clicks on various elements haven't revealed color options.

3) In this type of interface, calendar color settings are often accessed through:
   - Right-clicking on the calendar name
   - Using a context menu or dropdown menu
   - Settings or properties dialogs

4) Given that regular left clicks haven't worked, let me try right-clicking on the Work calendar checkbox to see if that brings up a context menu with color options:

```click("126", button="right")```

This should show a context menu with calendar settings including color options. After seeing what appears, I can then proceed with selecting the peacock color. If this doesn't work, we may need to look for other UI elements or try different interaction patterns.

Let me analyze the situation:

1) I've been trying various approaches to change the calendar colors but haven't been successful in accessing the color settings through different clicks and right-clicks.

2) Since my previous attempts haven't revealed the color options menu, I need to reconsider my approach.

3) In the accessibility tree, I notice that the Personal calendar has an associated checkbox (bid "143") and text paragraph, similar to the Work calendar structure.

4) Given that direct clicks and right-clicks on the Work calendar haven't produced results, let me try clicking on the associated three dots/more menu for Personal calendar first:

```click("143")```

This should attempt to interact with the Personal calendar settings. After seeing the result of this action, I can determine if:
- A menu appears with color options
- I need to try a different approach
- There might be a system limitation preventing access to color settings

Let me see what happens with this action before deciding on the next step.

Let me analyze the current situation:

1) I've made multiple attempts to access calendar color settings but haven't been successful. My past actions included:
   - Clicking various elements associated with both calendars
   - Trying right-clicks
   - Attempting to access menu options

2) The lack of success suggests that either:
   - The color settings might not be accessible through the methods I've tried
   - The interface might have limitations on color customization
   - I might be missing a more obvious way to change colors

3) At this point, I should acknowledge that I might not be able to accomplish this task as intended if the interface doesn't provide direct access to color settings.

4) The consistent TimeoutErrors and lack of visible color options in the accessibility tree suggest this functionality might not be available in the current implementation.

Given this analysis, I should report that this task appears to be infeasible:

```report_infeasible("I cannot find a way to assign color codes to the calendars. The interface does not appear to provide accessible controls for changing calendar colors. Despite trying multiple approaches including clicking various elements, using right-clicks, and looking for menu options, there are no visible controls or settings for changing calendar colors in the current implementation.")```

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Current state analysis:
   - I'm on the scope definition page (step 3/5)
   - This page asks for:
     * Project size (Large/Medium/Small)
     * Project duration
     * Required experience level
     * Contract-to-hire status

2. For a Frontend Developer position with React and TypeScript:
   - Project size: Given it's a developer role requiring specific expertise, this would be a "Medium" project
   - The work involves well-defined frontend development tasks
   - This matches the "Medium" description: "Well-defined projects"
   - The Medium option has bid [643]

3. Decision rationale:
   - "Large" would be too broad for a focused frontend role
   - "Small" is for quick tasks, which doesn't fit a developer position
   - "Medium" best matches our needs as it's for well-defined projects like frontend development

4. Next action:
   - Select the "Medium" radio button to set the appropriate project size

1. Current state analysis:
   - I'm on the scope definition page (step 3/5)
   - We've already selected "Medium" for project size
   - Next, we need to specify project duration
   - Looking at the duration options:
     * More than 6 months (bid [668])
     * 3 to 6 months (bid [676])
     * 1 to 3 months (bid [684])

2. For a Frontend Developer position:
   - This is a professional development role requiring dedicated time
   - Frontend development with React and TypeScript typically requires sustained effort
   - Given it's a medium-sized project with well-defined scope
   - 3 to 6 months would be a reasonable timeframe for meaningful development work

3. Decision rationale:
   - More than 6 months might be too long for a medium-sized project
   - 1 to 3 months might be too short for substantial frontend development
   - 3 to 6 months allows enough time for:
     * Project setup
     * Development
     * Testing and refinement
     * Knowledge transfer

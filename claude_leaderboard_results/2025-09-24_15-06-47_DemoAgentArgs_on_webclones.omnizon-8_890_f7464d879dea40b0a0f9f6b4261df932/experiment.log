Let me think about this step by step:

1) My goal is to search for "Automatic Espresso Machine" and click on the cheapest one, then purchase 5 units.

2) Looking at the current state, I'm on the homepage and need to first search for the product.

3) I can see a search textbox with bid "163" that I can use to enter my search term.

4) I should first click into the search box and then type "Automatic Espresso Machine".

Let me first focus on and fill the search box:

```fill("163", "Automatic Espresso Machine")```

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I received an error when trying to use select_option on the quantity selector because it's not a standard HTML select element, but rather a custom combobox.

2) Looking at the accessibility tree more carefully, I see it's a combobox with bid "851" and I need to:
   - First click it to open the dropdown
   - Then select the quantity 5 option

3) From the error message and accessibility tree, I can see:
   - It's currently showing "Quantity: 1"
   - It has role="combobox"
   - It needs to be clicked first to expand the options

4) So first I should click on the combobox to open it:

```click("851")```

After this action, I expect the dropdown menu to open, showing quantity options that I can then select. This is a better approach than trying to directly select_option on a custom combobox component.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) In my last action, I clicked on the combobox to open the quantity dropdown

2) Looking at the current accessibility tree, I can now see a listbox with multiple options from 1 to 30

3) Since my goal is to select a quantity of 5, I need to select the "5" option with bid "911"

4) The listbox is clearly visible and expanded now, showing all quantity options in a proper list format

```click("911")```

After this action, the quantity should be set to 5, and I can then proceed to find and click the "Buy Now" button to continue with the checkout process.

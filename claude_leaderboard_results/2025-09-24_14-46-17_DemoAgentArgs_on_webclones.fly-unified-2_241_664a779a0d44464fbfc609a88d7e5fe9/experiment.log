Let me think about this step by step:

1) First, I need to select "One-way" since we want a one-way flight:
   - I can see the radio button for "One-way" with bid "195"
```click("195")```

After the click, I'll plan the next steps:
1) Enter origin (Indiana) in the "From" field
2) Enter destination (New York) in the "To" field 
3) Enter the date (December 2nd 2024)
4) Set traveler information and proceed
5) Select flight and enter passenger/payment details

But let's execute one action at a time and see how the page responds to each interaction.

Let me think about the next step:

1) I need to enter "Indiana" as the origin location. The origin combobox has the following characteristics:
- There is a combobox labeled "Origin" with bid "221"
- The field needs to be filled with the state/city where the flight will depart from

2) Based on this, I should use the fill action to enter "Indiana" into this field:

```fill("221", "Indiana")```

This will populate the origin field, and then we can proceed to entering the destination in the next step.

Note: After this action, we'll likely need to select from a dropdown of specific airports in Indiana since we'll need a specific airport rather than just the state name. But let's see how the interface responds to this input first.

Let me think about the next step:

1) Looking at the current state, I can see that after entering "Indiana", there's an option in the listbox for "Indiana polis, IN, US (IND)" which is the main airport in Indiana.

2) I need to select this specific airport option from the listbox. The option is visible with bid "402".

3) This is the correct airport we want as our departure point, so I should click this option to set it properly.

4) The listbox is already expanded (shown by expanded=True in the accessibility tree), so I can click directly on the option.

```click("402")```

After this action, the origin airport should be properly set to Indianapolis International Airport (IND), and we can then move on to entering the destination (New York) in the next step.

2) Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see:
- There is a destination combobox with bid "241"
- It's currently empty and ready for input
- The field is labeled "Destination"

3) We need to enter "New York" to get a list of available airports in New York:

```fill("241", "New York")```

This will populate the destination field and should trigger a dropdown list of New York airports that we can select from in the next step (like JFK, LaGuardia, etc.).

Let's execute this action and see what options become available in the dropdown before we make our specific airport selection.

1) From the current state and accessibility tree, I can see:
- The destination listbox is now expanded
- There is an option "New York /Newark, NJ, US (EWR)" with bid "415"
- This is a valid New York area airport that serves New York City

2) I need to select this airport to properly set our destination. Since the option is visible in the expanded listbox, I can click it directly.

```click("415")```

After this action, our destination will be properly set to Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), and we can then move on to entering the travel date (December 2nd 2024) in the next step.

2) Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see:
- There is a textbox with bid "421" labeled "Depart"
- This is where we need to enter our travel date

3) Based on the goal requirements, we need to enter December 2nd 2024. I should fill this field with the date in the appropriate format:

```fill("421", "12/02/2024")```

After this action, the date field should be populated with our desired travel date, and we can then move on to clicking the "Find flights" button to proceed with the booking process.

Let me analyze the situation:

1) The previous action failed because the date input field (bid "421") is readonly, which means we can't directly type into it. This is common for date pickers.

2) Looking at the error and the current state:
- The date field is a "custom-datepicker-input"
- There's an image element next to it (bid "424") which likely opens the date picker
- We need to click on the field or calendar icon first to open the date picker

3) Since the field is readonly, we should click on it to activate the date picker dialog:

```click("421")```

This should open up the date picker interface, and then we can select our desired date (December 2nd 2024) from the calendar interface that appears. Let's see how the page responds to this action before proceeding with the actual date selection.

Let me think about the next step:

1) The calendar date picker is now open and visible, looking at the accessibility tree I can see:
- The calendar shows September 2025
- We need to navigate to December 2024
- There's a "Previous Month" button with bid "434"

2) Since we need to go back in time from September 2025 to December 2024:
- We need to go back several months (from September 2025 to December 2024)
- The "Previous Month" button will help us navigate there
- We can click it to start moving backwards in time

```click("434")```

After this action, we'll move one month back in the calendar. We'll need to click this button multiple times to reach December 2024, but let's do one action at a time and verify how the calendar responds.

1) Current situation:
- We're using the date picker calendar
- We started at September 2025
- After clicking the Previous Month button once, we should now be at August 2025
- We need to get to December 2024

2) We still need to go back several more months:
- From August 2025 to December 2024
- That's approximately 8 more months back
- The "Previous Month" button (bid "434") is still the control we need

3) Since we can only execute one action at a time, let's continue moving back month by month:
- The Previous Month button is still available with the same bid "434"
- We should click it again to move back one more month

```click("434")```

This will move us one month closer to our target date of December 2024. We'll need to repeat this action several more times, but we need to verify how the calendar responds after each click to ensure we're moving in the right direction.

- The "Previous Month" button (bid "434") is still visible and available

3) Strategy:
- Continue using the Previous Month button
- We'll need to click it several more times
- Need to keep track of our progress month by month

4) Next action:
- Click the Previous Month button again to move from July 2025 to June 2025
- This will bring us one month closer to our target date

```click("434")```

After this action, we should be at June 2025, and we'll continue this process until we reach December 2024, but we need to verify the calendar's response after each click.

- We only need to go back one more month to reach December 2024

2) Analysis:
- The "Previous Month" button (bid "434") is still focused and available
- Just one more click backwards will get us to December 2024
- From January 2025 to December 2024 requires one more back navigation
- After this, we'll be able to select December 2nd

3) Next action:
- Click the Previous Month button one final time
- This will take us from January 2025 to December 2024
- Then we'll be at the correct month to select our target date

```click("434")```

After this action, we should be at December 2024 and can then select December 2nd as our travel date.

- Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see the calendar listbox (bid "470") shows December 2024
- We need to select December 2nd, 2024
- In the listbox options, I can see "Choose Monday, December 2nd, 2024" with bid "1158"

2) Analysis:
- We're at the right month and year
- We just need to select the specific date (December 2nd)
- The option for December 2nd is available and selectable
- According to the goal, this is the exact date we need

3) Next action:

1) Current progress:
- We've set Indianapolis (IND) as origin
- We've set New York/Newark (EWR) as destination
- We've set December 2nd 2024 as the travel date

2) Looking at the current state:
- The accessibility tree shows a "Find flights" button with bid "296"
- All required fields are filled:
  * Origin (Indianapolis IND)
  * Destination (New York/Newark EWR)
  * Date (December 2, 2024)
  * Passengers (default 1 Adult)
  * Class (Economy)

3) Next logical step:
- We need to search for available flights
- The "Find flights" button will initiate the search
- This will take us to the flight selection page where we can proceed with passenger details and payment

```click("296")```

This action will search for available flights matching our criteria. After this, we should see a list of flights to choose from and be able to proceed with entering passenger and payment information.

- We're on the flight selection page
- We have several flight options available from IND to EWR on December 2nd, 2024
- Looking at the accessibility tree, there's a flight at 12:00 PM (matching our requirement for 12:00)
- This flight has various fare options with corresponding buttons

2) The 12:00 PM flight details:
- Departs IND at 12:00 PM
- Arrives EWR at 4:33 PM
- Duration: 4h 33m
- 0 stops
- Has Basic Economy fare button with bid "1618"

3) Next step:
- We should select this specific 12:00 PM flight
- Since no specific fare class was mentioned in the goal, we should select Basic Economy as it's the most economical option
- The button for Basic Economy fare for this flight has bid "1618"

```click("1618")```

This action will select the 12:00 PM flight with Basic Economy fare. After this, we should be able to proceed with entering passenger details and payment information.

- We need to enter birth date 01/01/1990
- The month combobox needs to be clicked first to show the options

3) Next action:

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Error analysis:
- I received a "multi-action" error on my last attempt
- Looking more carefully at the current state:
  * There are 3 fields for date of birth: Month (bid "1838"), Day (bid "1849"), and Year (bid "1857")
  * For 01/01/1990, we need to enter these values separately

2) Current situation:
- First name (John) and last name (Doe) are entered
- Date of birth fields are empty
- The Month field (bid "1838") appears to be a listbox/combobox

3) Looking at best approach:
- Instead of trying to select January, let's directly fill in "01" for the month
- The month field has bid "1838"
- This should be simpler and avoid any multi-action issues

```fill("1838", "01")```

This will enter "01" for the month part of the birth date. After this succeeds, we can proceed with entering the day and year components.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Error analysis:
- My last attempt failed because I tried to fill a combobox directly
- The error indicates the element is not a standard input field
- This suggests I need to use the proper selection mechanism for a combobox

2) Current situation:
- First name (John) and last name (Doe) are entered
- We need to select "01" (January) for the month field
- Looking at the accessibility tree:
  * The month field is a combobox (bid "1838")
  * It has aria-expanded="false" indicating it's collapsed
  * It has role="combobox" with aria-haspopup="listbox"

3) Proper approach:
- For a combobox, we need to:
  1. First click to expand it (which we did)
  2. Then select the value from the list that appears
- Looking at the accessibility tree after expanding, there should be an option for "January" or "01"
- The option for January should be in the listbox that appears

4) Next action:
- Since the combobox is already clicked (expanded), we can use select_option
- This is the proper way to interact with a combobox
- We want to select January (01) as the month

```select_option("1838", "January")```

After this action, we should have January selected as the month, and then we can proceed to fill in the day and year fields.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) First, I need to search for a one-way flight from Charlotte to Norfolk on December 10th

2) Looking at the current state:
- I need to switch from Roundtrip to One-way radio button first
- I'll need to fill in origin (Charlotte) and destination (Norfolk)
- Set the date for December 10th

3) Let's start with switching to One-way flight:
- I see the radio button with label "One-way" and bid 198

```click("198")```

The next steps will be:
- Fill in Charlotte (CLT) as origin
- Fill in Norfolk (ORF) as destination  
- Set date to December 10th
- Click search to find flights
- Evaluate departure times and prices
- Book if departure is before noon

But let's do this one step at a time, starting with switching to one-way flight.

Let me think about the next step:

1) Now that I've switched to one-way flight, I need to fill in the origin city (Charlotte)

2) Looking at the page:
- I can see the origin input field with the placeholder "Origin"
- It's a combobox with bid 224

3) I'll fill in "Charlotte" in the origin field:

```fill("224", "Charlotte")```

After this, my next steps will be:
- Fill in Norfolk as destination
- Set the date to December 10th
- Search for flights
- Check departure times and prices
- Book if a flight meets our criteria (before noon)

But let's first make sure we get the origin city entered correctly.

2) Looking at the current state:

3) I'll fill in "Norfolk" in the destination field:

```fill("244", "Norfolk")```

After this, my next steps will be:

1) I've already:
- Switched to one-way flight
- Set Charlotte as origin
- Set Norfolk as destination

2) The next step is to set the date to December 10th

3) Looking at the page:
- I see a textbox labeled "Depart" with bid 398
- We need to input December 10th

4) I'll fill in the date in an appropriate format (MM/DD/YYYY):

```fill("398", "12/10/2023")```

After this, my next steps will be:
- Click the search/find flights button
- Review the flight options
- Book if there's a flight before noon that meets our criteria

But first let's make sure we get the date entered correctly.

Let me analyze the situation:

1) My last action failed because I tried to directly fill in the date field, but the error message indicates it's a read-only input field (probably a date picker)

2) Looking at the page again:
- The date field (bid 398) is marked as "readonly"
- This typically means it needs to be clicked first to open a date picker modal

3) The logical next step would be to click on the date field to open the date picker:

```click("398")```

After this succeeds:
- The date picker should open
- We can then select December 10th
- Then proceed with searching for flights and reviewing options

Let's first get the date picker opened so we can properly set our travel date.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Current situation:
- I've clicked on the date field which should have opened the date picker
- Looking at the page, I can see the calendar view showing September 2025
- I need to navigate to December 2023 to select December 10th

2) Available controls:
- I see a month dropdown showing "September" (bid 430)
- I see a year dropdown showing "2025" (bid 444)
- I see navigation buttons for Previous/Next Month
- We want December 2023

3) We need to set the correct month and year first:
- We can use the month dropdown to select December
- The bid for the month combobox is 430
- Then we'll need to adjust the year

4) Let's first change the month to December:

```select_option("430", "December")```

After this:
- We'll need to change the year to 2023
- Then select the specific date (10th)
- Proceed with searching for flights

But first let's get the month changed properly.

Let me think about the next step:

1) Current situation:
- I've successfully changed the month to December
- Now I need to change the year to 2023
- I see the year combobox with bid 444 currently showing 2025

2) However, looking at the year options available in the combobox (bids 445-448):
- The available years are only 2022-2025 
- I notice we're being shown December 2025 in the calendar view
- The year 2023 appears to be in the past relative to the current calendar

3) Given this limitation:
- We cannot book a flight for December 10, 2023 as that date is in the past
- Looking at the available dates, we should aim for December 10, 2025 instead
- This appears to be the soonest December 10th we can select

4) Since we're already showing December 2025:
- We can directly select December 10th, 2025 from the calendar
- Looking at the options, I see bid 562 for "Choose Wednesday, December 10th, 2025"

```click("562")```

After this:
- The date should be set to December 10, 2025
- We can proceed with searching for flights
- Then we'll evaluate departure times and prices to see if any flights meet our criteria

  * One-way flight
  * From Charlotte to Norfolk
  * Date: December 10th (2025)
  * Economy class is already selected by default

2) The next logical step is to search for flights:
- Looking at the page, I see a "Find flights" button with bid 299
- This will let us see the available flights and their times/prices

3) Let's click the search button:

```click("299")```

After this:
- We should see search results with flight options
- We'll need to:
  * Review departure times (looking for flights before noon)
  * Check prices to find the cheapest option
  * Book if we find a suitable flight that meets our criteria

Let's first get the search results so we can evaluate our options.

1) Looking at my past actions and the error message:
- I successfully set Charlotte as origin
- I successfully set Norfolk as destination
- I failed to directly set the date because it was readonly
- Then I had several thoughts at once that led to a multi-action error

2) What I really need to do next is simply:
- Click the search/find flights button to see available flights

3) Looking at the current page state:
- I can see the "Find flights" button with bid 299

4) I'll perform a single action to search for flights:

```click("299")```

This simple action will let us proceed to see the flight options, where we can then evaluate departure times and prices to meet our criteria of finding the cheapest flight that departs before noon.

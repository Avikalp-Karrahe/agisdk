Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the goal, we need to find a window seat on a one-way flight from IND to BOI on December 5th, 2024, taking the earliest morning flight in Economy class.

2) First, I need to set up the basic flight search parameters:
   - Change from roundtrip to one-way
   - Enter departure city (IND)
   - Enter arrival city (BOI)
   - Set the date
   - Ensure Economy class is selected (which it already is)

3) Looking at the current page state, the "One-way" radio button is visible but not selected (checked='false'). This should be our first step.

4) The radio button for "One-way" has bid "195" based on the accessibility tree.

Therefore, I will click the one-way radio button first:

```click("195")```

This will change the flight search type from roundtrip to one-way, which matches our requirements. After this, I will need to input the origin, destination, and date information in subsequent steps.

Let me correct my approach:

1) I notice I received an error message indicating I provided a multi-action response, when only single actions are allowed.

2) My reasoning was correct, but I need to focus solely on the next immediate action without explaining future steps.

3) The first step remains the same - we need to change from roundtrip to one-way flight by clicking the one-way radio button which has bid "195".

```click("195")```

Let me analyze the situation:

1) My last action resulted in a timeout error when trying to fill in the date field. The error message indicates the input element is "not editable" and is marked as "readonly".

2) This suggests the date field is likely a special date picker component that requires clicking to open the calendar widget first, rather than direct text input.

3) Looking at the accessibility tree, there is a 'Depart' textbox with bid "395" - but since it's readonly, we need to click it first to activate the date picker.

Therefore, I will click the date field to open the date picker:

```click("395")```

3) According to the calendar interface shown in the screenshot, we're currently showing September/October 2025 which is past our target date.

4) Looking at the accessibility tree, there is a "Previous Month" button with bid "420" that we can use to navigate back to December 2024.

5) We need to go backwards from September 2025 to December 2024, so clicking the Previous Month button is the next logical step.

3) Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see the "Previous Month" button with bid "420" is still available.

4) We need to keep moving backwards until we reach December 2024, so clicking the Previous Month button again is the correct next action.

- Clicked the "Find flights" button

2) Based on the goal, we need to find the closest window seat to the front of the plane on the earliest morning flight.

3) However, looking at the accessibility tree, I don't see any flight results yet. This could mean:
   - The page is still loading
   - There was an error in the search
   - The accessibility tree hasn't been updated to show the new state

4) The most appropriate action right now would be to wait a moment for the page to load and update with flight results.

```noop(2000)```

This will give the page time to load and display the flight search results, after which we can proceed with selecting the earliest morning flight and choosing a window seat.

Let me think about the current situation:

1) After my last action (waiting 2000ms for the page to load), I can see that I'm still on the initial booking page. This suggests either:
   - The flight search didn't go through properly
   - There might be validation errors
   - We need to ensure all required fields are properly filled

2) Looking at the error messages in the accessibility tree, I can see "Please enter a valid origin" and "Please enter a valid destination" messages.

3) This indicates that despite my earlier attempts to fill IND and BOI, the form isn't recognizing these inputs properly. We need to use the combobox functionality correctly.

4) I should first properly fill the origin field (IND) using the combobox with bid "221". The field needs specific focus and proper airport code input.

```focus("221")```

The focus will allow us to properly interact with the combobox for entering the departure airport, after which we can properly enter "IND" in the next step.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at my past actions, I have:
- Selected one-way flight
- Attempted to fill in IND and BOI but got validation errors
- Just focused on the origin combobox (bid "221")

2) Now that I have focused on the origin input, I need to enter "IND" into it so it can properly recognize and select the airport from the dropdown list that should appear.

3) Since we have validation errors saying "Please enter a valid origin", we need to ensure we're entering the airport code in a way that allows the combobox to recognize it.

4) Looking at the accessibility tree, the combobox is now focused and ready for input. The next logical step is to fill it with "IND" so we can select Indianapolis International Airport from the dropdown that will appear.

```fill("221", "IND")```

This will enter "IND" into the focused origin combobox, which should trigger the dropdown with matching airports for selection.

Let me think about the current situation:

1) Looking at my past actions, I have:
- Selected one-way flight
- Focused on the origin combobox
- Filled in "IND" in the origin field

2) According to the accessibility tree, there's now a listbox with options including "Indianapolis, IN, US (IND)" as option "1234".

3) To properly select the airport and avoid validation errors, we need to click this specific option from the dropdown list rather than just typing the airport code.

4) Since the matching airport option is available with bid "1234", we should click it to properly select Indianapolis as our origin.

```click("1234")```

This will properly select Indianapolis International Airport (IND) from the dropdown list, which should resolve the origin validation error.

Let me think about the current situation:

1) Looking at my past actions, I have:
- Selected one-way flight
- Properly selected Indianapolis (IND) from the origin dropdown
- Now need to handle the destination selection

2) Looking at the accessibility tree, we still have a validation error for the destination. We need to properly select Boise (BOI) using the same dropdown approach we used for the origin.

3) The destination combobox has bid "241" according to the accessibility tree, and we need to focus it first before we can enter and select BOI.

4) Just like with the origin field, we need to properly interact with the combobox by first focusing on it.

```focus("241")```

This will allow us to then enter "BOI" and select Boise from the dropdown in subsequent steps.

2) Now that I have focused on the destination input, I need to enter "BOI" into it so it can show the dropdown with Boise Airport as an option.

3) Similar to how we handled the origin field, we need to enter the airport code to get matching results in the dropdown, then select the proper option.

4) The destination combobox is now focused and ready for input, so I should enter "BOI" to trigger the dropdown with matching airports.

```fill("241", "BOI")```

This will enter "BOI" into the focused destination combobox, which should trigger the dropdown with matching airports for selection, allowing us to properly select Boise Airport in the next step.

2) Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see a listbox has appeared with option "1250" for "Boise, ID, US (BOI)".

3) Similar to how we handled the origin selection, we need to click the specific option from the dropdown to properly select the airport and avoid validation errors.

4) Therefore, I need to click the option with bid "1250" to properly select Boise as our destination.

```click("1250")```

This will properly select Boise International Airport (BOI) from the dropdown list, which should resolve the destination validation error.

Let me think about the current situation:

1) Looking at my past actions, I have:
- Selected one-way flight
- Properly selected Indianapolis (IND) as origin
- Properly selected Boise (BOI) as destination
- Previously attempted to set the date but had some errors

2) Now that both airports are properly selected, we need to handle the date selection again. The date input has bid "1257" according to the accessibility tree.

3) Since this is a date picker component, we need to click it first to open the calendar widget before we can select December 5th, 2024.

4) Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see the date textbox with bid "1257" marked as "Depart".

Therefore, I should click the date field to open the date picker:

```click("1257")```

Let me think about this step by step:

1) To find flights from Dallas to Fresno on December 4th, I need to:
   - Fill in the origin (Dallas)
   - Fill in the destination (Fresno)
   - Set the departure date
   - Switch to one-way flight since only one date is mentioned

2) Looking at the current state, first I should switch to one-way flight since we're only interested in flights on December 4th.

3) I can see there's a radio button for "One-way" with bid "204".

Let me click the one-way radio button first.

```click("204")```

Note: After this action, I'll proceed with filling in the origin, destination, and date fields to search for the flights on December 4th.

Let me think step by step:

1) I've already selected one-way flight option. Now I need to fill in the origin field.

2) Looking at the page, I can see:
   - A combobox for Origin with placeholder text (bid "230")
   - We need to enter "Dallas"

3) The combobox accepts text input, so I should fill in "Dallas" to search for flights from there.

4) The bid for this combobox is "230" based on the accessibility tree.

Let me fill in the origin field with "Dallas":

```fill("230", "Dallas")```

After this action, I'll proceed with filling in the destination (Fresno) and setting the departure date to December 4th.

   - Filled in Dallas as the origin

2) Next, I need to fill in Fresno as the destination.

3) Looking at the accessibility tree:
   - There's a destination combobox with bid "250"
   - It's labeled as "Destination"
   - It's currently empty and ready for input

4) The action needed is to fill this combobox with "Fresno"

```fill("250", "Fresno")```

After this action, I'll need to set the departure date to December 4th to complete the search criteria.

   - Set Dallas as origin
   - Set Fresno as destination

2) Next, I need to set the departure date to December 4th.

3) Looking at the accessibility tree:
   - There's a textbox for "Depart" with bid "404"
   - I need to input December 4th

4) For date inputs, I should use a standard date format to ensure it's accepted properly. The format MM/DD/YYYY should work.

```fill("404", "12/04/2023")```

After this action, I'll be able to click the "Find flights" button to see how many flights are available.

Let me analyze the situation:

1) My last action resulted in an error because I tried to directly fill in the date field, but the error message indicates that the input is readonly:
   - The element has "readonly" attribute
   - It's described as "custom-datepicker-input" in the class name
   - Direct text input is not allowed

2) For date picker fields that are readonly, we typically need to:
   - Click on the field first to open the date picker
   - Then select the date through the calendar interface that appears

3) Looking at the current state:
   - We need to click on the Depart field (bid "404") to open the date picker
   - This should reveal a calendar interface where we can select December 4th

Let me click on the date field to open the date picker:

```click("404")```

After this action, a calendar interface should appear where we can select December 4th.

Let me think step by step:

1) Current state after clicking the date field (bid "404"):
   - The calendar interface is now visible
   - Looking at the comboboxes for month and year:
     * The current month displayed is September 2025
     * Need to change to December 2023

2) I need to:
   - Change the month from September to December
   - Change the year from 2025 to 2023
   - Then select the 4th day

3) Looking at the accessibility tree:
   - There's a month combobox with bid "436" set to "September"
   - There's a year combobox with bid "450" set to "2025"
   - The month should be changed first

4) The month combobox (bid "436") has a menu with all months, and I need to select "December"

Let me select December in the month dropdown:

```select_option("436", "December")```

After this action, I'll need to:
- Change the year to 2023
- Select the 4th day of the month

2) Next step needed:

   - Looking at the accessibility tree:
     * Year combobox has bid "450"
     * It currently shows 2025
     * 2023 is available as an option

3) For changing the year:
   - I need to use select_option with bid "450"
   - Select "2023" as the value

```select_option("450", "2023")```

After this action, I'll need to select December 4th from the calendar grid to complete the date selection.

3) Action needed:
   - Click on December 4th
   - This will select the date and close the calendar
   - The bid to use is "638"

```click("638")```

After this action, I can proceed to click the "Find flights" button to see how many flights are available.

2) However, looking at the current state of the page:
   - The origin field shows an error message "Please enter a valid origin."
   - The destination field shows an error message "Please enter a valid destination."
   - This suggests that my inputs weren't properly registered by the form

3) I need to revise my approach:
   - The comboboxes for origin and destination likely require selecting from a dropdown list
   - Simply typing the city names wasn't sufficient
   - I should click or focus on the origin field first to see the available options

Let me start by focusing on the origin field:

```click("230")```

After this action, a dropdown with available cities should appear, allowing me to select Dallas properly.

2) Past actions:

   - Need to properly select from the dropdown list instead

3) Next logical step:
   - Select Dallas/Fort Worth from the dropdown list
   - This option has bid "891"
   - Need to click this option to properly set the origin

After this action, I'll need to select Fresno from the destination dropdown in a similar manner.

Let me think step by step:

1) Current state:
- All search parameters are properly set
- The search results are visible
- I can clearly see 3 flights available
- I got an error on my last attempt because I tried to directly send a message

2) The error message indicates:
- Only single actions are allowed
- I need to just send the message without additional commentary

3) To accomplish the goal:
- I just need to report the number of flights available
- Keep the message clear and direct
- Use only the send_msg_to_user action

```send_msg_to_user("3 flights are available from Dallas to Fresno on December 4th")```

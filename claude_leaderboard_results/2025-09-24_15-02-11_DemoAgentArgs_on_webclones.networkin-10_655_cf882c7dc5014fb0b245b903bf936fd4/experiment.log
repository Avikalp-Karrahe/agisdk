Let me think about this step by step:

1) The goal is to generate a polite follow-up message starting with "Following up on"

2) Based on looking at the page:
   - We're on a social media feed interface
   - There's a messaging section but we need to compose a message

3) The most appropriate message would be polite and professional for a business context.

4) Let me send a professional follow-up message:

```send_msg_to_user("Following up on our previous conversation. I wanted to check if you had a chance to review my message. Looking forward to hearing back from you.")```

This action will send a polite, professional follow-up message that:
- Starts with "Following up on" as requested
- Is courteous and not pushy
- Shows interest in continuing the conversation
- Maintains a professional tone appropriate for business communication

Let me think about this step by step:

1) The goal is to change the "Team Check-In" event on July 18, 2024 to "Project Kickoff" and update the location to "Zoom"

2) Looking at the calendar view, I need to first click on the "Team Check-In" event to open its details
- The event is located on Thursday July 18th at 11am-12pm
- I can identify its button by the bid [840]

3) Clicking this event should open up the event details dialog where I can make the changes

```click("840")```

I'll wait for the event details dialog to open after clicking this button, then I can proceed with making the requested changes to the event name and location.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the current state, the event details dialog is now open as evidenced by the accessibility tree showing the event details.

2) To edit the event details, I need to click the "Edit event" button, which has bid [1010] according to the accessibility tree.

3) This will open up the event editing form where I can make the changes to the event name and location.

```click("1010")```

The edit event page should open after this action, where I can then proceed to update the event name to "Project Kickoff" and change the location to "Zoom".

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm now on the event edit page, and I can see from the accessibility tree that there are two main things I need to change:
   - The title field which currently shows "Team Check-In" (bid: 1076)
   - The location field (bid: 1130)

2) Let's start by changing the event title from "Team Check-In" to "Project Kickoff"
   - I can see the textbox with bid 1076 that has value "Team Check-In"
   - I need to fill this with the new title "Project Kickoff"

3) I'll use the fill action to update the title field first, and then in subsequent steps will update the location.

```fill("1076", "Project Kickoff")```

After this action completes, I'll proceed with updating the location to "Zoom".

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I've successfully changed the event title to "Project Kickoff" as shown in the current state
   - I can see the title is already updated in the accessibility tree showing value="Project Kickoff"

2) Now I need to update the location to "Zoom"
   - Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see the location textbox with bid 1130
   - This appears to be empty right now as it shows "Add location"

3) I'll use the fill action to set the location to "Zoom"
   - This textbox has bid 1130
   - I want to enter "Zoom" as the new location value

```fill("1130", "Zoom")```

After this action completes, both the title and location will be updated as requested. We'll then need to save these changes.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I've successfully completed both required changes:
   - Changed the event title to "Project Kickoff" ✓
   - Updated the location to "Zoom" ✓

2) Looking at the current state:
   - The accessibility tree shows both changes are in place
   - The title shows "Project Kickoff"
   - The location field shows "Zoom"

3) To complete this task, I need to save these changes
   - I can see there's a "Save event" button with bid 1078 in the accessibility tree
   - This will commit our changes and return to the calendar view

4) The logical next action is to click the save button to preserve our changes

```click("1078")```

This action will save our changes and complete the goal of updating both the event name and location.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Based on the current accessibility tree, I notice that while we've been trying to update the "Team Check-In" event, we may not have actually clicked on the correct event yet.

2) Looking at the events shown for July 18th (Thursday), I can see in the accessibility tree the button for the Team Check-In event we need to modify:
   - It actually shows up with bid [2016] with text "Event color indicator Project Kickoff 11am - 12pm"

3) While we tried to click on bid [840] earlier, that element doesn't appear in the current accessibility tree. We need to click on the correct event button first to begin making our changes.

4) Since we need to click on the event to edit it, I'll click on the correct event button:

```click("2016")```

This will open up the event details dialog, and then we can proceed with making the necessary changes through the edit form.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the current state shown in the accessibility tree:
   - The event details dialog is open
   - The event is already showing "Project Kickoff" as the title
   - The location is already showing "Zoom"
   - The other details like time and description are correct

2) This means our previous actions have actually already successfully completed the goal:
   - The event name has been changed from "Team Check-In" to "Project Kickoff" ✓
   - The location has been updated to "Zoom" ✓

3) Since our goal has been fully achieved, and the changes are already saved (as evidenced by them showing up in the event details view), we can simply close the event details dialog.

4) In the accessibility tree, I can see the "Close event popover" button with bid [2186]

```click("2186")```

This will close the event details dialog since our goal has been completed successfully. The changes are already saved and in place.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the current state and my past actions:
   - I initially clicked on the wrong bid thinking it was [840]
   - Then realized the correct event was bid [2016] which I clicked
   - When I clicked on bid [2016], I noticed the event was already showing "Project Kickoff" and "Zoom"

2) Current state analysis:
   - Looking at the accessibility tree, the event on July 18th already shows:
     - Title: "Project Kickoff"
     - Time: 11am - 12pm
   - All the changes we wanted to make are already in place

3) Goal check:
   - Change event name to "Project Kickoff" ✓ (already done)
   - Update location to "Zoom" ✓ (already done)
   - Both changes are already saved and visible in the calendar

4) Since our goal has been achieved and all changes are already in place, we don't need to make any further changes. I'll inform the user:

```send_msg_to_user("The event has already been updated successfully - it is now showing as 'Project Kickoff' with location 'Zoom' on July 18th from 11am to 12pm.")```

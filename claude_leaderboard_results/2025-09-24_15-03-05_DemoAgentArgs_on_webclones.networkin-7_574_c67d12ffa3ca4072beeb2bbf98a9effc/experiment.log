Let me think about this step by step:

1) The goal is to search for three users who have worked at Amazon and list their current job positions.

2) Looking at the current page state:
   - I can see a feed of different user posts and profiles
   - There's a search box in the header with bid "63"
   - I need to use this search box to find Amazon employees

3) Best next action:
   - I should start by using the search box to look for "Amazon"
   - This will help find users who have worked at Amazon

Therefore, I will:
```fill("63", "Amazon")```

This will allow me to find relevant profiles of Amazon employees in the subsequent search results. After this, I can analyze the results and list their current positions.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Current situation:
   - I've filled in the search box with "Amazon"
   - I can see an Amazon search result preview with its logo
   - To see all search results and find former Amazon employees, I need to click on "See all results"

2) Looking at the accessibility tree:
   - I can see a "See all results" heading with bid "602"
   - This is what I need to click to get the full search results

3) Next logical step:
   - Click on the "See all results" option to view all profiles related to Amazon
   - This will help me find profiles of people who have worked at Amazon

Therefore, I will:
```click("602")```

This should take me to a page with search results showing Amazon-related profiles, where I can then identify three users who have worked at Amazon and note their current positions.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Current situation:
   - I have searched for "Amazon" and need to find three users who worked there
   - Looking at the current page, I can see Mike Rubino's profile mentions "AWS" in his experience
   - His profile shows he's currently "Co-Founder & Chief Product Officer" at Syelo
   - He's one of our target users having worked at AWS (Amazon Web Services)

2) Next steps:
   - I should record this information and continue searching for other Amazon alumni
   - I see multiple other profiles but need to scroll to find more potential Amazon employees

3) Given Mike Rubino is our first find, I should report this initial finding while continuing the search:
```send_msg_to_user("Found first Amazon alumnus: Mike Rubino - Current position: Co-Founder & Chief Product Officer at Syelo (Previously at AWS)")```

This provides the first result while I continue searching for two more former Amazon employees.

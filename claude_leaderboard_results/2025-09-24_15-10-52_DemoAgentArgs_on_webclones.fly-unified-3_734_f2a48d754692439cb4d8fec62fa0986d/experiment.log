Let me think about this step by step:

1) To find the price for a Premium Economy flight, I need to:
   - Enter Indiana as origin
   - Enter New York as destination  
   - Set the date to December 2nd
   - Change class to Premium Economy
   - Search for flights

2) First, I need to enter Indiana in the Origin field. Looking at the page, I see a combobox for Origin with bid 229.

3) I should first click/focus on the combobox before entering text.

Let me click on the Origin combobox first:
```click("229")```

This will allow me to start entering the origin location. After this, I'll proceed with entering "Indiana", setting the destination, date, and other requirements step by step.

Let me think about the next step:

1) I successfully clicked on the Origin field and can see it's expanded with a list of options

2) Looking at the listbox options, I can see "I n d i a n a p o l i s , I N , U S ( I N D )" as one of the options

3) Since Indiana is a state and Indianapolis is its main airport, this is the correct option to select for flights from Indiana

4) Looking at the accessibility tree, this option has bid 1210

5) I can use select_option to choose this destination

```select_option("229", "I n d i a n a p o l i s , I N , U S ( I N D )")```

This will select Indianapolis as our origin city. After this succeeds, I'll proceed with selecting New York as the destination.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) My last action failed because I tried to use select_option on an input/combobox element that isn't a traditional <select> element

2) Looking at the interface, I can see it's an autocomplete-style input field where I need to:
   - Type the text first
   - Then select from the filtered options that appear

3) Since I already clicked and focused on the field (bid 229), I can now fill it with "Indianapolis" to find the option

4) Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see the field accepts text input for searching airports

```fill("229", "Indianapolis")```

After this, I'll be able to select the specific Indianapolis option from the filtered results that appear. Then I'll proceed with selecting New York as the destination.

Let me think about the next step:

1) I've successfully focused and filled the origin field with "Indianapolis"

2) Looking at the accessibility tree, there's a destination combobox field with bid 249 that has the label "Destination"

3) Before I can enter New York, I need to click/focus on this destination field

4) After clicking, I'll be able to enter "New York" and select from the filtered options that appear

```click("249")```

After this succeeds, I'll be able to enter "New York" in the destination field and proceed with selecting the specific airport option, then move on to setting the date and cabin class.

3) Since this is one of the major New York airports and it appears in the filtered list, I should select it

4) Similar to before with Indianapolis, I need to fill the field with "New York" to help filter and select the right option

```fill("249", "New York")```

After this succeeds, I'll be able to select the specific New York airport option from the filtered results, then move on to setting the date (December 2nd) and changing the cabin class to Premium Economy.

2) Looking at the page's current state:

   - The listbox shows filtered results including EWR
   - I need to select the specific airport option

3) Since I need to select the specific New York/Newark option that's visible, I should click on it

2) Looking at the accessibility tree:

   - The current date format shown in the screenshot suggests MM/DD/YYYY format

3) I need to set the date to December 2nd at 12:00
   - Looking at the field, it seems to be a text input field
   - Since we're looking for a specific date and time, I should enter 12/02

```click("4902")```

After this succeeds, I'll be able to:
- Enter the date
- Change the cabin class to Premium Economy
- Search for flights to get the price information

2) Now I need to enter December 2nd as the date:
   - Looking at the field format and accessibility tree, it accepts date input
   - Since we need a specific date and time (12:00 on December 2nd), I should enter "12/02"
   - The year isn't specified in the goal, so I'll use the current year 2024

3) The date field is currently focused after my last click action, so I can directly fill it

```fill("4902", "12/02/2024")```

After this succeeds, I'll:
- Select Premium Economy from the cabin class dropdown
- Click search to find flights and get the price information

Note: If there are any issues with the date format, I may need to adjust it based on the website's expected format.

1) My last action failed because:
   - The date field (bid 4902) is readonly
   - Direct filling with text is not allowed
   - I need to use the calendar picker interface instead

2) Looking at the accessibility tree:
   - The date field is currently focused
   - I see a calendar widget with months and years
   - There are comboboxes for month (bid 4924) and year (bid 4938)

3) To set December 2nd:
   - I need to first select December from the month dropdown
   - The month combobox is bid 4924 and shows "September" currently

4) So my next action should be to select December from the month dropdown

```select_option("4924", "December")```

After this succeeds, I'll:
- Set the year if needed
- Select December 2nd from the calendar
- Change to Premium Economy class
- Search for flights to get the price

3) Since December 2nd is available in the current view:
   - I don't need to change the year
   - I can directly click on December 2nd

```click("5048")```

After this succeeds, I'll:
- Change the cabin class from Economy to Premium Economy
- Click search to find flights and get the price information

   - I see a listbox "Travel Class" with multiple options
   - The "Premium economy" option is visible with bid 5130
   - It's currently not selected (selected=False)

3) I need to select Premium Economy to get the correct price for this cabin class

4) Since the dropdown is expanded and the option is visible with bid 5130, I can click directly on "Premium economy"

```click("5130")```

After this succeeds, I'll:
- Click the "Find flights" button to search and get the price information
- Report back the Premium Economy price for the flight

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I received an error message saying "Received a multi-action, only single-actions are allowed"

2) Looking at the accessibility tree again:
   - I see the "Travel Class" listbox (bid 5127)
   - The "Premium economy" option (bid 5130) is available
   - The option is currently not selected (selected=False)

3) Since this is a proper listbox element, I should use select_option instead of click:
   - This is the proper action for selecting an option from a listbox
   - The parent listbox bid is 5127
   - "Premium economy" is the value I want to select

4) The correct single action would be to use select_option with the listbox's bid

```select_option("5127", "Premium economy")```

This will properly select Premium Economy as the travel class. After this succeeds, I'll click the "Find flights" button to search and get the price information.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at what I've done so far:
   - Set Indianapolis as origin
   - Set New York/Newark (EWR) as destination
   - Set the date to December 2nd
   - Clicked and opened the cabin class selector

2) Looking at the accessibility tree:
   - The listbox for "Travel Class" is present (bid 5127)
   - "Premium economy" option is available (bid 5130)
   - It's a simple listbox with single selection

3) My last action failed because I included multiple steps in my reasoning. I need to focus on just one action.

4) The correct single action should be:
   - Using click on the "Premium economy" option (bid 5130)
   - This is simpler than select_option and will work since the listbox is already open

```click("5130")```

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I've successfully:
   - Set Indianapolis as origin
   - Set New York/Newark (EWR) as destination
   - Set the date to December 2nd
   - Selected Premium Economy as the cabin class

2) Looking at the accessibility tree:
   - There's a "Find flights" button with bid 304
   - This is the main search button to get flight results and prices
   - The button is visible and clickable

3) To get the price information:
   - I need to click this button to search for flights
   - This will show me the available flights and prices for my selected criteria

4) The next logical action is to click the "Find flights" button:

```click("304")```

After this succeeds, I'll be able to see the search results and report back the specific price for the Premium Economy flight at 12:00 on December 2nd.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Let's review what I've done:
   - Set Indianapolis as origin
   - Set New York/Newark (EWR) as destination
   - Set the date to December 2nd
   - Selected Premium Economy class
   - Clicked the "Find flights" button

2) Analyzing the current state:
   - Based on my experience with flight search interfaces, I would expect to see flight results with prices
   - However, looking at the accessibility tree, I don't see any flight results or prices
   - I notice there's still an error message saying "Please enter a valid origin."

3) This suggests that:
   - The search failed because the origin (Indianapolis) wasn't properly set
   - I need to properly select Indianapolis from the origin dropdown

4) Therefore, I should:
   - Go back to the origin field (bid 229)
   - Type "Indianapolis" and select from the dropdown properly

```click("229")```

This will focus the origin field again so I can properly set Indianapolis as the departure city in my next action.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Current situation:
   - I've clicked back on the origin field (bid 229)
   - The error message indicates "Please enter a valid origin"
   - The origin field appears to be a combobox with autocomplete functionality

2) Looking at the accessibility tree:
   - The origin combobox is focused and expanded
   - There's a clear list of options available
   - I see "I n d i a n a p o l i s , I N , U S ( I N D )" as option 5934

3) Previous attempts:
   - Direct text input and select_option didn't work properly
   - We need to select the specific Indianapolis option from the list
   - The option is directly visible in the listbox with bid 5934

4) Best next action:
   - Since the dropdown is open and the Indianapolis option is visible
   - I should click directly on the Indianapolis option (bid 5934)
   - This will properly set the origin city

```click("5934")```

This will select Indianapolis as the origin city. After this succeeds, the "Please enter a valid origin" error should clear, and we can proceed with searching for flights.

1) Let's review my current situation:
   - I need to reenter destination since we're starting over
   - Origin is now properly set to Indianapolis (IND)
   - Looking at the accessibility tree, I see the destination field (bid 249)

2) What's changed:
   - Origin is properly set
   - The error message about invalid origin should be gone
   - I need to set the destination to New York/Newark again

3) Next logical step:
   - Click on the destination field
   - This will allow me to enter "New York" and select EWR
   - The destination combobox has bid 249

4) Best next action:
   - Click on the destination field to focus it
   - This will open the dropdown for destination selection

```click("249")```

This will focus the destination field so I can enter and select New York/Newark in my next action.

   - Looking at the accessibility tree, "New York/Newark, NJ, US (EWR)" is visible as option 7386
   - The option is available in the expanded listbox

3) Previous experience:
   - Direct clicking on the option worked better than fill or select_option
   - The option is clearly visible in the expanded dropdown

4) Best next action:
   - Click directly on the New York/Newark option (bid 7386)
   - This will properly set the destination

```click("7386")```

After this succeeds, I'll proceed with setting the date to December 2nd and selecting Premium Economy class.

   - The field shows "Dec 2" as its current value
   - Date format appears to be already correct

3) Since the date is already showing correctly as "Dec 2", I don't need to modify it

4) Next steps needed:
   - Select Premium Economy class
   - Looking at the accessibility tree, I see a Travel Class combobox (bid 287)

5) Best next action:
   - Click on the Travel Class combobox to open the dropdown
   - This will allow me to select Premium Economy in the next step

```click("287")```

This will open the cabin class dropdown so I can select Premium Economy in my next action.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the error message:
   - The click on "Find flights" button failed
   - There appears to be an autocomplete dropdown still open
   - The dropdown is intercepting the click events
   - Specifically, the Atlanta (ATL) option (bid 7387) is blocking the button

2) Current page state:
   - Origin is set to Indianapolis
   - Destination field appears to still have its dropdown open
   - The destination autocomplete is interfering with other actions

3) Problem analysis:
   - I need to close the destination dropdown before I can click the search button
   - Clicking outside the dropdown or pressing Escape usually closes these dropdowns
   - Looking at the accessibility tree, I see the destination combobox (bid 249)

4) Best next action:
   - Press Escape key on the destination field to close its dropdown
   - This should clear any open autocomplete dropdowns
   - Then I'll be able to click the search button

```press("249", "Escape")```

This should close the dropdown and allow me to proceed with clicking the search button in my next action.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Current status:
   - Origin is set to Indianapolis (IND)
   - Destination is set to New York/Newark (EWR)
   - Date is set to Dec 2
   - Premium Economy is selected
   - I just pressed Escape to close the dropdown

2) Next needed action:
   - Click the "Find flights" button
   - Looking at the accessibility tree, the button has bid 304
   - The dropdowns should now be closed after pressing Escape
   - This will initiate the search to show flight prices

3) The current page state:
   - All required fields are properly set
   - No dropdowns appear to be blocking the button
   - The "Find flights" button should be clickable

4) Best next action:
   - Click the "Find flights" button (bid 304)
   - This should display the search results with prices

```click("304")```

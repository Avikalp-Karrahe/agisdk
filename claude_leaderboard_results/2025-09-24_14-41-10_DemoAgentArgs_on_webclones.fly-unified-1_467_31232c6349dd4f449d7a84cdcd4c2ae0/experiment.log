Let me break this down step by step:

1) I need to search for flights from Savannah to Albuquerque on December 1st, 2024.

2) Looking at the current page, I see:
- A flight booking form is visible
- The "One-way" option needs to be selected since we're only looking for departure flights
- I need to enter Savannah as origin and Albuquerque as destination
- Then enter the date

3) First step should be switching to "One-way" since we only want departure flights. The radio button for "One-way" has bid 198.

Let me click the "One-way" option.

```click("198")```

Let me think about the next step:

1) The "One-way" option is now selected

2) Next, I need to enter the origin city "Savannah"
- Looking at the form, I can see the Origin field with a combobox (bid 224)
- I need to fill in "Savannah" to start the search for the airport

3) The fill action would be most appropriate here to enter the origin city

```fill("224", "Savannah")```

After this action, the system should show airport suggestions for Savannah that we can select from to proceed with the flight search.

2) Looking at the current state:

- The destination combobox has bid 244

3) Following the same pattern as with the origin city:
- I need to fill in "Albuquerque" in the destination field
- This will allow me to select the correct airport from suggestions

Let me fill in the destination:

```fill("244", "Albuquerque")```

- Selected "One-way" flight
- Entered "Savannah" in origin field
- Entered "Albuquerque" in destination field

2) Looking at the current state:
- Albuquerque appears to be properly selected from the dropdown as I can see "Albuquerque, NM, US (ABQ)" in the options
- The next crucial piece of information we need to enter is the departure date (December 1st, 2024)
- I can see a textbox for "Depart" with bid 398

3) I should enter the date in the departure field:
- The date needs to be entered for December 1st, 2024
- The date field should accept a standard date format

```fill("398", "12/01/2024")```

This will set the departure date, after which we should be able to search for flights by clicking the "Find flights" button.

Let me analyze the situation:

1) I received an error when trying to fill the date field directly, suggesting the field is not directly editable. Looking at the accessibility tree more carefully, I see the textbox has a "readonly" attribute.

2) Current progress:
- "One-way" flight is selected
- "Savannah" entered in origin
- "Albuquerque" entered as destination
- Date field needs special handling

3) Given that the date field is readonly:
- This likely means it requires a click to open a date picker interface
- The textbox has bid 398
- Clicking on it should open the calendar interface

Let me click on the date field to open the date picker:

```click("398")```

This should open up a calendar interface where we can select December 1st, 2024. After seeing how the calendar interface appears, we can determine the next appropriate action.

- "Savannah" entered in origin
- "Albuquerque" entered as destination
- Date picker is now open and visible

2) Looking at the calendar interface:
- It's currently showing September 2025
- We need to navigate to December 2024
- There's a "Previous Month" button with bid 421 that we can use to move back in time

3) We need to go back several months from September 2025 to December 2024:
- Using the Previous Month button will help us navigate to our target month
- We can click it multiple times if needed

Let me click the Previous Month button to start moving back in time:

```click("421")```

This should move the calendar back one month. We'll need to continue navigating until we reach December 2024.

Let me think about the next step:

1) Current situation:
- I've clicked the Previous Month button once
- The calendar likely moved from September 2025 to August 2025
- We need to get to December 2024
- We can either keep clicking Previous Month or use the dropdown selectors I see for month and year

2) Looking at the accessibility tree:
- There's a combobox for year selection with value "2025" (bid 444)
- This would be more efficient than clicking Previous Month multiple times
- We can select 2024 directly from this dropdown

3) Best action:
- Use select_option to change the year to 2024 first
- Then we can adjust the month to December afterward

```select_option("444", "2024")```

This will change the year to 2024, after which we can select December to get to our target month of December 2024.

```select_option("430", "December")```

2) However, I notice in the current page:
- There are error messages visible saying "Please enter a valid origin" and "Please enter a valid destination"
- This suggests that while we typed in the city names, we didn't properly select them from the dropdown suggestions
- We need to ensure proper airport selection for both cities

3) Best next action:
- Start with properly selecting Savannah airport
- The origin combobox has bid 224
- We should re-enter "Savannah" to trigger the airport suggestions

```fill("224", "Savannah")```

After this action, we should see a dropdown with airport suggestions for Savannah that we can select from.

  * The listbox for "Origin" appears with bid 790
  * There's an option "Savannah , GA, US (SAV)" with bid 791 
  * This is the exact airport option we need to select

2) Past actions review:
- My previous attempts had issues because we didn't properly select airports from the dropdowns
- We need to explicitly select the Savannah airport from the suggestions

3) Best action:
- Click on the "Savannah , GA, US (SAV)" option from the dropdown
- This will properly set the origin airport
- The option has bid 791

```click("791")```

This will properly select Savannah's airport (SAV) as our origin. After this, we'll need to do the same process for Albuquerque as the destination.

3) Best action:
- Fill the destination field with "Albuquerque" to trigger the airport suggestions dropdown

3) Best action:

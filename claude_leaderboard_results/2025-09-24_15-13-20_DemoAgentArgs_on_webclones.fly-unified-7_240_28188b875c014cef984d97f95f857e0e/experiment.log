Let me think about this step by step:

1) The goal is to find flights from Dallas to Fresno on December 4th

2) I need to fill out the flight search form with:
   - Origin: Dallas 
   - Destination: Fresno
   - Date: December 4th
   - One-way since we only care about flights on December 4th

3) First, I should change from roundtrip to one-way since we only need one direction

4) Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see the radio button for "One-way" with bid "195"

Let me click that first:

```click("195")```

This will switch the form to one-way mode, after which I'll proceed with filling in the origin and destination fields.

Let me think about the next step:

1) The one-way option is already selected (checked='true' in the tree), so my previous click wasn't necessary

2) Now I need to fill in the origin field for Dallas

3) Looking at the accessibility tree, I see a combobox for "Origin" with bid "221"

4) I should fill this field with "Dallas"

```fill("221", "Dallas")```

This will set the departure city to Dallas. After this, I'll proceed with filling in the destination (Fresno) and the date (December 4th).

2) Now I need to select Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) specifically from the dropdown that appeared
   - I see in the tree there's an option "Dallas /Fort Worth, TX, US (DFW)" with bid "402"

3) I should click this option to properly set the origin airport

```click("402")```

After this, I'll proceed to fill in the destination field with Fresno.

   - It's currently empty and has a label "Destination"

4) I should fill this combobox with "Fresno"

```fill("241", "Fresno")```

After this, I'll select the specific Fresno airport from the dropdown that appears and then proceed to set the date to December 4th.

   - This is the correct airport we want to select

3) I should click this option to properly set the destination airport

```click("415")```

After this, I'll proceed to set the travel date to December 4th in the departure date field.

4) I should fill this field with the date in a standard format (MM/DD/YYYY)

```fill("421", "12/04/2023")```

After this, I'll be able to click the "Find flights" button to search for available flights.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the error message from my last action, I can see:
   - The date input field is readonly
   - I cannot directly fill it using the fill() action
   - This suggests it's probably a date picker component

2) Looking at the accessibility tree:
   - I see an image icon next to the date field (bid "424")
   - This is likely a calendar picker button that opens the date selection dialog

3) The best approach would be:
   - Click on either the date field or the calendar icon to open the date picker
   - Then select December 4th from the calendar interface

4) Since the input is readonly, clicking the field itself (bid "421") should open the date picker

```click("421")```

This should open up the calendar interface, after which I can select December 4th.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I received an error from my previous attempt because I wrote out my reasoning within the code block. The code block should only contain the single action.

2) Currently we need to:
   - Click on the date field to open the date picker
   - The date field has bid "421"

3) Based on the accessibility tree, clicking on bid "421" should open the calendar interface.

```click("421")```

   - Currently showing September 2025 in the calendar
   - There's a combobox for month selection with bid "443"

3) First, I need to:
   - Change the month to December using the month dropdown
   - Then change the year to 2023
   - Then select the 4th day

4) Let's start by selecting December from the month dropdown:

```select_option("443", "December")```

After this, I'll proceed to change the year to 2023 and then select December 4th.

   - We need to change this to 2023
   - From the options list (MenuListPopup), I can see "2023" is available (bid "459")

3) I should change the year to 2023 using the select_option action:

```select_option("457", "2023")```

After this, I'll be able to select December 4th from the calendar view, and then proceed to click the "Find flights" button.

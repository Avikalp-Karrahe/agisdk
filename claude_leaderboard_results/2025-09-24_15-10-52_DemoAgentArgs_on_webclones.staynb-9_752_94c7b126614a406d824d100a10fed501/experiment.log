Let me think about how to find the best stay with the maximum number of guests supported:

1) Looking at the current page, I see we need to first click on the "Who" field to check guest capacity options.

2) The "Who" field has a bid of "68" according to the accessibility tree.

3) Let me click on this field to see the guest selection options.

```click("68")```

This should open up the guest selection interface and allow me to see the maximum number of guests supported. From there, I can then make a selection of the maximum number and move forward with booking the stay.

Let me think about the next step:

1) I clicked on the "Who" field and now I can see the guest selection interface showing different categories: Adults, Children, Infants, and Pets.

2) To book with maximum guests, I should try incrementing each category to see what the limits are.

3) Let's start with Adults first by clicking the "Add Adults guest" button which has bid "1763".

```click("1763")```

This should increment the number of adult guests by 1. I'll continue adding until I hit the maximum limit.

Let me think about the next step:

1) I clicked the "Add Adults guest" button once, incrementing the adult count from 1 to 2. I should continue adding adults to find the maximum limit.

2) Looking at the current state, I can try clicking the "Add Adults guest" button (bid "1763") again to add another adult.

3) I'll keep doing this until I either:
   - Hit an error message indicating maximum capacity
   - Notice the button becomes disabled
   - Or observe some other limitation

```click("1763")```

This should increment the adult count to 3 if allowed. From there, I can determine if we've hit the maximum yet.

Let me think about the next step:

1) I've been clicking the "Add Adults guest" button to increase the number of adults. Let me check what happened after my last click:

2) Looking at the current page state:
   - I can see "Add Adults guest" button is still active
   - No error messages are shown
   - I want to continue increasing until I hit the limit 

3) Since there's no indication that we've hit a maximum limit yet, I should:
   - Continue clicking the "Add Adults guest" button (bid "1763") 
   - Keep track of how many adults I've added
   - Watch for any signs that we've reached capacity

4) So far I've gone from:
   - Initially 2 adults
   - Added 1 adult → 3 adults
   - Next click should try for 4 adults

```click("1763")```

This should increment the adult count to 4 if allowed. I'll continue this process until I find the maximum capacity.

Let me analyze the current situation:

1) Looking at my past actions:
   - I started with 3 guests shown in the "Who" field
   - I opened the guest selection menu by clicking the field
   - I've clicked the "Add Adults guest" button multiple times 
   - I haven't seen any error messages or disabled state yet

2) Looking at the current state:
   - The guest selection interface is still open
   - The "Add Adults guest" button (bid "1763") is still active
   - The current count appears to be at 4 adults
   - No error messages or limitations are shown

3) Since my goal is to find the maximum number of guests supported:
   - I should continue increasing the adult count until I hit a limit
   - The system will likely show some indication when I hit the maximum
   - The button should either become disabled or show an error

4) Next logical step:
   - Click the "Add Adults guest" button again to try for 5 adults
   - Watch for any feedback indicating we've hit the limit
   - If successful, continue this pattern until we find the maximum

```click("1763")```

This should attempt to increase the adult count to 5 if allowed. I'll continue monitoring the response to determine if this hits any capacity limits.

1) Looking at my past actions:
   - Started with clicking the "Who" field to open guest selection
   - Have been incrementing the Adults count by clicking "Add Adults guest" button
   - Started at 4 guests, now should be at 5 adults
   - No error messages or limits encountered yet

2) Looking at the current state:
   - Guest selection interface is still open
   - "Add Adults guest" button (bid "1763") appears to still be active
   - There's no indication that we've hit a maximum limit
   - We want to find the absolute maximum guests allowed

3) Strategy:
   - Continue increasing the adult count until we hit some limit
   - Watch for any error messages, disabled states, or other indicators
   - Once we hit the adult limit, we can try adding children/infants/pets
   - This will help us find the total maximum guest capacity

4) Next logical step:
   - Click the "Add Adults guest" button again to try for 6 adults
   - Continue until we get some indication of reaching a limit
   - If no limit yet, keep incrementing

```click("1763")```

This will attempt to increase the adult count to 6 (if allowed). I'll continue watching for any indication that we've reached a maximum capacity limit.

   - "Add Adults guest" button appears to still be clickable
   - Continuing to test maximum capacity
   - Current count shows we're at 6 adults

3) Given my goal to find maximum guests supported:
   - Should continue increasing until we hit a system-imposed limit
   - Keep watching for any error messages or disabled states
   - Will try adding another adult to see if 7 is allowed
   - Once we hit adult limit, can try other categories (children/infants/pets)

4) Decision:
   - Continue with incrementing adults by clicking the same button
   - No indication we've hit a limit yet
   - Should try for 7 adults to see if that's allowed

```click("1763")```

This will attempt to increase the adult count to 7 (if allowed). I'll continue monitoring for any indication that we've reached a maximum capacity limit.

   - Started by opening the guest selection menu
   - Have been incrementing the Adults count from 6 to 7
   - Just clicked to try to add a 7th adult
   - Haven't seen any error messages or disabled states yet

2) Looking at the current state:
   - I notice the value shown in the text input shows "6 Guests"
   - This suggests we may have hit the maximum limit at 6 guests
   - The system appears to be preventing going beyond 6 guests
   - Since we can't add more adults, and this seems to be the limit

3) Decision:
   - We appear to have found the maximum guest limit of 6
   - We should now proceed with searching for stays with this maximum capacity
   - The "Search stays" button with bid "69" is available
   - This will show us available properties that can accommodate 6 guests

4) Next logical step:
   - Click the "Search stays" button to see properties that can handle 6 guests
   - This will help us find appropriate stays for the maximum guest capacity

```click("69")```

This should search for available stays that can accommodate the maximum of 6 guests we've determined.

- I opened the guest selection interface
- I incrementally increased adult guests until I hit the maximum of 6 guests
- I clicked the search button to find properties that can accommodate 6 guests
- The page now shows a list of available properties for 6 guests

2) Given my goal to book a stay with maximum guests supported:
- I've already determined the maximum is 6 guests
- The page has loaded various properties that can accommodate 6 guests
- I should now select one of the available properties to proceed with booking
- Looking at the listings, each one appears to be a clickable link

3) Next logical step:
- Choose one of the available properties to book
- Since they all support 6 guests, I'll select the first available listing
- The first listing "Cabin in the woods" has bid "87"

```click("87")```

This will take us to the property details page for the first available listing that can accommodate our maximum of 6 guests, allowing us to proceed with the booking process.

- I need to change this to 6 guests to book at maximum capacity
- The dates are already pre-selected (Jul 18 - Jul 24)

3) Next logical step:
- Click the "GUESTS" field to open the guest selection interface
- This will allow me to set the number of guests to the maximum of 6

```click("557")```

This should open the guest selection interface where I can adjust the number of guests to our desired maximum of 6 guests. Once this opens, I can then increment the guest count to 6 and proceed with the booking.

1) Past actions and progress:
- Started on property details page
- Clicked GUESTS field to open selection interface
- Increased adults from 1 to 3 using "Add Adults guest" button
- Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see:
  * Currently at "3" adults (node [748])
  * Looking at the property details (node [180]), it shows "2 guests · 1 bedroom · 1 bed · 1 bath"

2) Important realization:
- The property listing itself shows it only supports 2 guests maximum
- This is a critical limitation I overlooked earlier
- Despite the system allowing me to select more, the property has a 2-guest capacity
- I've exceeded the actual property limit

3) Decision:
- I should send a message to the user explaining the situation
- Need to clarify that while the system can handle 6 guests, this specific property only accommodates 2 guests
- Should recommend finding a different property that can actually accommodate more guests

```send_msg_to_user("I notice that while trying to book with maximum guests, this specific property only supports 2 guests maximum according to its listing details. We should return to the search page and look for properties that can actually accommodate more guests. This cabin is too small for your needs.")```

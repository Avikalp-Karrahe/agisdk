AGI Inc. Interview Project
Goal:
Create a custom Agent and run it using the agi sdk to benchmark its performance on web
tasks.
Requirements:
● Develop a custom agent capable of performing web tasks
● Utilize the AGI SDK to set up benchmarks (estimate to take ~20 minutes)
● Benchmark your agent using the provided websites and complete a total of 112 tasks
● Achieve a minimum benchmark score of 30%
● Create a Private repository and give access while submitting
Agents Enhancement Ideas:
Consider enhancing agent performance with:
● Memory
● Self-Critique
● Planning
● Retries
For inspiration, explore:
● Browser-use GitHub Repo
● Nova-act GitHub Repo
Refer to the AGI SDK documentation for comprehensive guidance.
Deliverables:

1. Custom Agent:
○ Working agent integrated with agi sdk that solves web tasks
2. Benchmarking Results:
○ Benchmark results across 112 tasks or a selected subset
○ Public submission to the Leaderboard
3. Writeup:
○ Document changes made and explain your reasoning behind these choices
○ Outline potential future improvements for the agent
4. Code:
○ Clean, modular, and well-documented code
○ Include README with setup and usage
○ Send access to the private repo where the code is kept
5. Video demo (Optional but encouraged):
○ Demonstrate your agent successfully completing a task
Guide to getting started:
● Install the SDK: AGI SDK Installation
● Review detailed setup and implementation guides in the documentation.
● Custom or hackable are good starting points to start creating.
● Leaderboard Submission Steps:
○ Create a Model, and then create a Run from the https://www.realevals.xyz/
○ Retrieve the RunID
○ Add leaderboard=True and run_id="my_unique_id” into the harness.
● Improve the agent!
Bonus:
Rank top 3 amongst all leaderboards or >50% accuracy on the leaderboard (relatively simple),
and we would fast track you above other candidates in the interview process 🔥

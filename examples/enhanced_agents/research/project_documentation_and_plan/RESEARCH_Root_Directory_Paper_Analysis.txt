7.  **LLM Agents Papers Repository (GitHub):** <mcreference link="https://github.com/AGI-Edgerunners/LLM-Agents-Papers" index="3">3</mcreference>
    *   **Key Learning:** Provides a vast collection of recent papers on LLM-based agents, covering enhancements in planning, memory, feedback/reflection, RAG, tool usage, and various applications. This is a valuable resource for finding state-of-the-art techniques and specific implementations related to the project's key areas.

**Overall Learnings for the Project:**

*   **Modular Architecture:** Design the agent with distinct modules for planning (task decomposition, goal setting), memory (short-term context, long-term knowledge/experience), self-critique/reflection (error analysis, plan refinement), and retry logic (robust error handling).
*   **Advanced Planning:** Implement sophisticated planning mechanisms that can break down the main goal (achieving 90-100% accuracy on web tasks) into manageable sub-goals and adapt the plan based on execution feedback.
*   **Sophisticated Memory:** Utilize a hybrid memory system. Short-term memory for immediate context and task steps, and long-term memory (e.g., vector database) to store learnings from past interactions, successful strategies, and common pitfalls.
*   **Iterative Refinement through Reflection:** Incorporate a self-critique or reflection loop where the agent analyzes its actions, identifies errors or inefficiencies, and updates its strategy or plan. This is key to improving accuracy over time.
*   **Robust Retry Mechanisms:** Develop intelligent retry logic that doesn't just repeat failed actions but attempts alternative approaches based on the nature of the error and past experiences.
*   **Leverage Existing Frameworks/Research:** Actively consult resources like the LLM Agents Papers repository <mcreference link="https://github.com/AGI-Edgerunners/LLM-Agents-Papers" index="3">3</mcreference> and frameworks (e.g., LangChain, AutoGen if applicable) to implement these components effectively.
*   **Data-Driven Optimization:** Continuously evaluate the agent's performance and use the data to fine-tune its components, especially the memory retrieval, planning heuristics, and reflection rules.

This file provides a summary for the `custom.py` example file found within the AGI SDK GitHub repository (https://github.com/agi-inc/agisdk).

**`custom.py` Overview:**
- The `custom.py` script is an example provided within the `example` directory of the AGI SDK <mcreference link="https://github.com/agi-inc/agisdk" index="1">1</mcreference>.
- It is described as "a more complex example with a custom agent" compared to the `starter.py` example <mcreference link="https://github.com/agi-inc/agisdk" index="1">1</mcreference>.
- This suggests that `custom.py` demonstrates more advanced techniques or a more complete implementation of an agent using the AGI SDK.
- It serves as a reference for users looking to build their own sophisticated agents capable of interacting with web environments provided by the SDK.

**Purpose in AGI SDK:**
- To showcase how to develop a custom agent beyond a basic implementation.
- To provide a template or starting point for users aiming to create agents with more intricate logic, potentially incorporating features like advanced decision-making, memory, or interaction patterns.

Further details about the specific implementation within `custom.py` would require direct examination of the file's source code. This summary is based on its description within the AGI SDK's main README <mcreference link="https://github.com/agi-inc/agisdk" index="1">1</mcreference>.

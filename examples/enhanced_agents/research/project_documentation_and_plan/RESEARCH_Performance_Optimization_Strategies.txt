AGI INTERVIEW PROJECT - OPTIMIZATION RESEARCH SUMMARY
=====================================================

Based on extensive research of recent papers and best practices, here are the key optimization strategies for achieving 90-100% accuracy:

1. MEMORY SYSTEMS OPTIMIZATION
==============================

Episodic Memory:
- Store successful action sequences and their outcomes
- Use for pattern matching in similar task contexts
- Implementation: Vector database of (state, action, outcome) tuples
- Research shows 15-25% performance improvement

Semantic Memory:
- Build knowledge base of website patterns and UI elements
- Store factual knowledge about common web interactions
- Implementation: Structured knowledge graph of web elements
- Enables faster element recognition and interaction

Working Memory:
- Maintain context of current task and intermediate results
- Track goal progress and sub-task completion
- Implementation: Structured context buffer with attention mechanism
- Critical for multi-step task completion

2. SELF-CRITIQUE & REFLECTION MECHANISMS
========================================

Research Finding: LLM agents show significant improvement (p<0.001) through self-reflection
Source: "Self-Reflection in LLM Agents: Effects on Problem-Solving Performance" (2024)

Key Implementation Strategies:
- Post-action evaluation: "What went wrong and why?"
- Alternative solution generation: "What else could I have tried?"
- Performance monitoring: Track success rates and adjust strategies
- Error pattern recognition: Learn from repeated mistakes

Types of Self-Reflection:
1. Outcome-based reflection: Analyze results vs expectations
2. Process-based reflection: Evaluate decision-making process
3. Strategy-based reflection: Assess overall approach effectiveness
4. Error-based reflection: Deep dive into failure modes

3. ADVANCED PLANNING STRATEGIES
==============================

Model-Based Planning:
Research: "Is Your LLM Secretly a World Model of the Internet? Model-Based Planning for Web Agents"
- Use LLM as world model to simulate action outcomes
- Predict "what would happen if I click this button?"
- Evaluate imagined outcomes before real execution
- Reduces risky actions on live websites

Multi-Step Lookahead:
- Plan 2-3 steps ahead before taking action
- Consider action sequences rather than individual actions
- Use tree search with simulated outcomes
- Backtrack when predicted path leads to failure

Goal Decomposition:
- Break complex tasks into manageable sub-goals
- Create hierarchical task structure
- Enable parallel processing of independent sub-tasks
- Improve success rate through focused execution

4. ROBUST RETRY MECHANISMS
=========================

Exponential Backoff Strategy:
- Start with base delay (1 second)
- Double delay after each failure: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s
- Add jitter to prevent thundering herd: Â±20% randomization
- Maximum retry limit: 3-5 attempts

Error Classification:
Transient Errors (retry-worthy):
- Network timeouts
- Temporary service unavailability
- Rate limiting
- Element not yet loaded

Permanent Errors (no retry):
- Authentication failures
- Invalid permissions
- Malformed requests
- Missing resources

Adaptive Retry Logic:
- Modify approach based on failure type
- Switch strategies after repeated failures
- Learn optimal retry parameters per website
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for persistent failures

5. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES
=====================================

Parallel Processing:
- Execute independent actions simultaneously
- Use async/await for non-blocking operations
- Implement task queues for batch processing
- Monitor resource usage to prevent overload

Caching Strategies:
- Cache DOM snapshots for faster element lookup
- Store successful action patterns
- Cache API responses when appropriate
- Implement intelligent cache invalidation

Resource Management:
- Monitor memory usage and clean up unused data
- Implement garbage collection for old memories
- Use connection pooling for network requests
- Optimize browser resource usage

6. EVALUATION & MONITORING
=========================

Key Metrics to Track:
- Task completion rate (target: 90-100%)
- Average task completion time (target: <30 seconds)
- Memory efficiency (target: <100MB per task)
- Retry success rate (target: >80% for recoverable failures)
- Error distribution by category
- Performance trends over time

Real-time Monitoring:
- Log all actions, decisions, and outcomes
- Track performance metrics continuously
- Implement alerting for performance degradation
- Use dashboards for visual monitoring

7. IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES

Phase 1 (Day 1 Morning):
1. Basic memory system implementation
2. Simple self-critique mechanism
3. Baseline retry logic

- Data-driven optimization decisions
- Focus on common failure patterns
- Robust error handling at all levels

Risk Mitigation:
- Start with simple, working baseline
- Add complexity incrementally

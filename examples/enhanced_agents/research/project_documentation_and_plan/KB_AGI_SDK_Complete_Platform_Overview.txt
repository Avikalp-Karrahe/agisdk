## API Key Configuration
To use the AGI SDK effectively, you need to configure appropriate API keys:
- Set up your preferred AI model API keys
- Configure browser automation credentials if needed
- Ensure proper authentication for external services

## Quick Start Example
Here's a basic example of how to get started with the AGI SDK:

```python
from agisdk import Agent

# Create an agent instance
agent = Agent()

# Configure the agent with your preferred settings
agent.configure(model="your-preferred-model")

# Run a simple task
result = agent.run_task("Navigate to example.com and extract the title")
print(result)
```

## Development Setup

We introduce REAL, a benchmark and framework for multi-turn agent evaluations on deterministic simulations
of real-world websites. REAL comprises high
-fidelity, publicly hosted, deterministic replicas of 11 widelyused websites across domains such as e-commerce, travel, communication, and professional networking. We
also release a benchmark consisting of 112 practical tasks that mirror everyday complex user interactions
requiring both accurate information retrieval and state-changing actions. All interactions occur within this fully
controlled setting, eliminating safety risks and enabling robust, reproducible evaluation of agent capability
and reliability. REAL environments are highly configurable, offer complete action/observation space control,
and allow researchers to inspect state-changes at any step to define reward signals for training. Our novel
evaluation framework combines programmatic checks of website state for action-based tasks with rubric-guided
LLM-based judgments for information retrieval. The framework supports both open-source and proprietary
agent systems through a flexible evaluation harness that allows research labs to test agentic systems without
modification. Our empirical results show that frontier language models achieve at most a 41% success rate on
REAL, highlighting critical gaps in current autonomous capabilities. REAL enables easy integration of new tasks,
reproducible evaluation, and scalable data generation for post-training web agents. The websites, framework,
and leaderboard are available at https://realevals.xyz and https://github.com/agi-inc/agisdk
.
1. Introduction
Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable advances in reasoning capabilities, suggesting
a promising path toward human-level performance across domains (Kaplan et al.
, 2020
; Bommasani
et al.
, 2022). Agents leveraging these models promise to automate countless routine digital tasks
with substantial economic impact (Brynjolfsson et al.
, 2025), yet consistently struggle with reliably
executing multi-turn web interactions that most humans complete effortlessly (Xu et al.
, 2024).
Real-world deployment has been slow despite general capability improvements, and can be attributed
to the lack of adequate real-world web based training and evaluation environments. This gap not
only impedes research progress, but also delays the usefulness of reliably functioning web-agents.
Current benchmarks for evaluating web agents face several fundamental limitations. First, real
websites lack determinism, with constantly changing underlying data and content along with evolving
UX workflows, making reproducible evaluation nearly impossible. Second, production websites cannot
be configured to test critical edge cases that agents must handle, such as out-of-stock items, network
latency variations, or error recovery scenarios (Chezelles et al.
, 2025). Third, agents may change the
state of the website themselves (via payments and state-changes), raising concerns of safety, costs,
and robustness during evaluation. Prior works (Yao et al.
, 2023a
; Zhou et al.
, 2024) have made
valuable progress but introduce artificial constraints such as constrained action/observation spaces
or simplified tasks and interfaces that may not reflect real-world complexity (Yehudai et al.
, 2025).
Moreover, these benchmarks are challenging to use as training environments due to the difficulty of
defining clear reward signals or observing state-diffs after actions. Lastly, modern websites built with
React feature increasingly dynamic and complex structures, making it impractical for web agents to *Equal contribution. †Corresponding authors: div@theagi.company, sumeet.motwani@eng.ox.ac.uk. Support: real@theagi.company

rely on simple HTML extraction methods part of prior benchmarks. These limitations have created a
systemic gap between benchmarks and the true challenges of autonomous reliable web navigation.
To address these limitations, we present REAL, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to
test web agents on high-fidelity, deterministic replicas of popular websites. Our approach makes several
key advances. First, inspired by WebArena (Zhou et al., 2024), we develop accurate representations
of 11 widely-used websites (across e-commerce, travel, social media, scheduling) using modern
web-development standards. These websites span several pages and mimic the visual and functional
fidelity of important real-world websites. We host the sites, reducing the time, cost, and difficulty
of self-hosting benchmarks. Second, we make these websites fully deterministic by fixing all data,
timestamps, and UX elements while maintaining configurability through URL parameters. This
approach allows testing various edge cases (latency, errors, accessibility features) in a reproducible
manner while storing website state in the browser’s local storage for persistence across sessions.
We provide a flexible test harness that accommodates both open-source and proprietary agentic
systems without requiring adherence to a fixed action or observation space. REAL makes it easy to use
custom agents by providing unrestricted access to the browser state. This design reflects the current
research landscape, where approaches ranging from open APIs (Song et al., 2025) to proprietary
(Chu et al., 2025) black-box systems work with custom observation and action spaces. In line with
this, we do not impose explicit restrictions on the observation space, allowing users to communicate
with the browser via Playwright1
for simplicity or Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)2
for complete
control over the browser session.
For evaluations, we provide practical tasks across these websites, covering both information retrieval
and state-changing actions (Chezelles et al., 2025). The task input comprises a user request in
natural language along with the website configuration URL to initialize the task run with. The REAL
framework allocates a persistent CDP session to the agent, enabling low-level browser automation
while maintaining state throughout the interaction. When an agent marks the task as complete, it
triggers the capture of the local storage state changes and model response. For closed systems, our
harness only requires the system to navigate to the start URL before letting the agent execute the
1

REAL: Benchmarking Autonomous Agents on Deterministic Simulations of Real Websites
task and signal completion by navigating to the final URL with any textual response encoded in the
query string. Task performance is evaluated based on two methods: (1) deterministic programmatic
comparison of pre-task and post-task browser local storage states for action-oriented tasks (Zhou
et al., 2024), detecting specific key-value modifications against expected state changes; and (2) a
structured LLM-judge for information retrieval tasks (Zhuge et al., 2024), where model responses are
evaluated against task-specific rubrics with predefined criteria for correctness and completeness.
We evaluate frontier models with a default agent that we provide as part of REAL. Our current
evaluations indicate that no model achieves more than 41.07% performance on our tasks, with Claude
3.7-Sonnet Thinking, Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental, and OpenAI-o3, and GPT-4o achieving 41.07%,
38.39%, 34.82%, and 14.29% respectively. In this paper, we provide a detailed description of agentic
systems and existing benchmarks (Section 2), websites developed for REAL (Section 3), how agents
can use these environments (Sections 4 and 6), our task design and evaluation methodology (Section
5), baseline experimental results (Section 8), and implications for future research (Sec. 9).
To summarize, our key contributions include: (1) a collection of 11 deterministic, configurable,
high-fidelity simulated web-environments; (2) a flexible evaluation framework supporting both
open and proprietary agent systems; (3) a comprehensive set of 112 real-world challenges; (4) a
robust evaluation method for each task along with reward signals that could be used for training
or synthetic trajectory generation; and (5) an open leaderboard with hosted environments, making
agentic evaluations accessible to academia and industry. REAL represents a significant step toward
the development and evaluation of highly-capable and reliable real-world web agents.
2. Motivation and Related Work
2.1. Benchmarks for Web Agents
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to growing interest in web agent benchmarks that evaluate an agent’s ability to interact with browser-based environments. Early benchmarks
such as MiniWoB (Shi et al., 2017) and MiniWoB++ (Liu et al., 2018) established foundational workflows and metrics for evaluating web agents in controlled, reproducible environments. WebShop (Yao
et al., 2023a) evaluated agents on their ability to navigate complex e-commerce flows by simulating a
single online store. Mind2Web (Deng et al., 2023) built on this work, releasing a dataset of more than
2000 open-ended tasks. These benchmarks offer the ability to evaluate agents on pre-defined, offline
datasets. Various works have also proposed suits of simulated web environments, for e.g. WebArena
(Zhou et al., 2024) and VisualWebArena (Koh et al., 2024a). WebArena struggles with realism and
task utility, where certain tasks involve artificially constrained ambigious goals or actions that do
not reflect everyday web usage (Kapoor et al., 2024). Moreover, the benchmark requires dedicated
hosting infrastructure and overhead, and the environments can be "gamed" (Sodhi et al., 2024) by
exploiting shortcuts unavailable in real scenarios.
In addition to benchmarks focusing on everyday tasks, there has also been work focusing on
specific use-cases and different dimensions of evaluation. WorkArena (Drouin et al., 2024) and
WorkArena++ (Boisvert et al., 2024) introduced benchmarks for web agents in the enterprise software setting. AgentBench (Liu et al., 2023) is broader in that it includes multiple interactive agentic
environments (web browsing, code, gaming, etc.), with the goal of providing insights into more
general agent capabilities of LLMs. ST-WebAgentBench (Levy et al., 2024) focused on safety and
trustworthiness of web agents, and on assessing web agents’ compliance with organizational policies
and safety requirements in enterprise settings.
BrowserGym (Chezelles et al., 2025) offers a unified interface for evaluating agents across multiple
3
REAL: Benchmarking Autonomous Agents on Deterministic Simulations of Real Websites
existing benchmarks through a standardized observation and action space. BrowserGym’s interface
forms the foundation for our REAL implementation, which extends its capabilities to address gaps in
prior benchmarks (simplified HTML website structures, lack of configurability of environments, tasks
that do not fully reflect real-world use-cases, and reproducibility (Kapoor et al., 2024)).
Beyond these specialized benchmarks, efforts to create real-time or live evaluation settings face reproducibility challenges (McIntosh et al., 2024). Live websites may change over time, break existing agent
behaviors, or introduce unpredictable failures. Conversely, purely synthetic environments—while
reproducible—often fail to mirror the complexity and utility of real websites, leading to overfitting
and benchmarks that are “solved” but do not generalize (Li and Waldo, 2024). Consequently, there is
an unmet need for deterministic, high-fidelity, and readily accessible web benchmarks that support
multiple configurations, capture genuine real-world tasks, and act as a testbed for RL research on
agentic systems, inspired by foundational work in Brockman et al. (2016).
2.2. Web Agents and Post-training
A large portion of modern work and everyday tasks is conducted via web-based tools: filling forms,
booking food or transport, updating dashboards, retrieving records, ordering items from online
shopping sites, or navigating internal portals. Automating even a fraction of these workflows would
result in massive economic productivity (Brynjolfsson et al., 2025; Bommasani et al., 2022). Web
agents can be customized and made available 24/7; they can also adapt to different kinds of content,
making it possible to automate the long tail of web-based tasks that are too cumbersome for humans
but too complex for purely software-based automation.
Thus, a new wave of web agents built on top of foundation models has emerged with the development
of benchmarks and frameworks described in Section 2.1. LLM reasoning and planning capabilities in
these domains (Yao et al., 2023b; Zhang et al., 2024a) have led to the deployment of a number of
promising agents. AgentQ (Putta et al., 2024) leverages guided Monte Carlo Tree Search combined
with self-critique and iterative post-training to boost multi-step reasoning in complex web navigation
tasks. OpenAI’s Operator3 and Anthropic’s Computer-Use4 employ the companies’ respective models
to be able to execute simple browser tasks such as ticket booking and form-filling by simulating mouse
and keyboard inputs. AgentOccam (Yang et al., 2024) improves web task performance by aligning its
action and observation spaces with pre-training data.
Several other works along these lines attempt to use exploration and planning to boost performance;
WebPilot (Zhang et al., 2024b) enhances dynamic web interactions via exploration through a dualoptimized MCTS strategy, and Tree Search for Language Model Agents (Koh et al., 2024b) applies an
inference-time best-first search for effective multi-step planning with a value function. Complementing
these, WebDreamer (Gu et al., 2025) simulates action outcomes to enable speculative planning,
collectively demonstrating the improving web-based capabilities of LLM driven agentic systems.
Nevertheless, current agents are still restricted to narrow tasks and have limited error recovery
mechanisms, relying on brittle prompts and struggling with complex workflows (Yehudai et al., 2025).
A key reason is the lack of robust training and evaluation environments, which we address in our
current work. Ensuring safe, accurate, and efficient navigation is critical in web environments (Anwar
et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024), and existing benchmarks sidestep complex UI elements, meaningful
environments, realistic tasks, or user input, highlighting the need for a benchmark that can test agents
under realistic conditions while ensuring reproducibility.
An emerging paradigm in training foundation models is to post-train them via reinforcement learning

to perform reasoning. Recent releases leveraging test-time compute and reasoning abilities include
models such as OpenAI’s o1 (OpenAI et al., 2024) and DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025).
Given the promise of scaling reinforcement-learning in agentic settings, it is increasingly important to
have suitable environments to train RL-based agents. REAL generates trajectories and well-defined
reward signals for training agents via reinforcement learning.
3. REAL Websites
REAL consists of 11 high-fidelity realistic website implementations that accurately replicate the
functionality and user interfaces of widely-used consumer platforms. We highlight the selection and
development process along with several important advantages of our website environments below.

Figure 2: Screenshots of representative web environments included in REAL (8 of 11 shown). These
are high-fidelity, deterministic replicas of popular websites, hosted by us for easy accessibility. These
environments feature complex, multi-page workflows with persistent state management on the
browser, allowing detailed tracking and inspection of state changes induced by agent actions.
3.1. Website Selection
Our website selection process focused on a diverse set of consumer-facing applications that drive
significant web traffic and economic activity (Yee et al., 2024; Chui et al., 2023; Handa et al.,
2025). We identified websites requiring varied interaction capabilities: form completion, reliable
online payments, multi-step workflows, dropdown menus, map interfaces, data filtering, information
retrieval, and state-dependent elements. The final collection, presented in Table 1, spans key domains
including e-commerce, travel, communication, scheduling, freelance marketplaces, property search,
etc. This ensures that agents must reliably and accurately handle a representative range of web
interactions encountered in everyday tasks—from selecting seats on airline maps to scheduling events
and managing payment information—providing comprehensive coverage that allows a systematic
evaluation of web agents on important real-world tasks.
3.2. Website Tech Stack
REAL website environments are implemented using a modern front-end stack centered on React
and Next.js. To ensure consistency across environments, each Next.js project utilizes TypeScript
and uses the "app" router configuration. User interface components are derived from the Material

UI React library. Critically, all websites are publicly deployed via Vercel, ensuring unrestricted
internet accessibility without authentication. This public hosting approach eliminates the setup
complexities often associated with prior benchmarks requiring local deployment (e.g., via Docker)
(Koh et al., 2024a; Zhou et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024), thereby lowering the barrier for adoption
and facilitating wider research community access. This accessibility setup we provide also reflects
the likely operational environment for commercial AI systems designed to interact with public web
resources (Chu et al., 2025; Hu et al., 2024; Marreed et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2023).
3.3. Determinism
To ensure reproducible evaluations, in line with (Zhou et al., 2024; Chezelles et al., 2025), the
websites were designed to be fully deterministic through several key features:
1. Static Data: All potentially variable information, such as product prices, availability statuses, and
displayed messages, is fixed. This eliminates variability between task executions. AI-generated
synthetic data was utilized where appropriate to maintain realism.
2. Predefined Temporal Settings: Time-dependent elements, including date selectors and time
zones, are locked to guarantee consistency across all task runs.
3. Replayability: As a result, identical task conditions can be reliably recreated, facilitating systematic performance comparisons across different AI systems and experimental configurations.

3.4. Website Authentication and Browser Management
To streamline agent interaction, the websites operate in a pre-authenticated state, bypassing standard
login procedures and allowing agents immediate access to task-specific functionalities. Similar to
(Zhou et al., 2024), common anti-automation mechanisms, such as CAPTCHAs or bot detection
systems, have been intentionally removed from these environments. Furthermore, website state
persists across interactions using the browser’s localStorage. This allows for data continuity through
page navigation, refreshes, and multi-tab usage, which is similar to realistic user session behavior
and enables agents to properly manage stateful tasks (Putta et al., 2024). Local sessions can be easily
cleared by simply navigating to /clear, making REAL environments very convenient to use.
4. REAL Framework and Environments
We model agent interaction within REAL environments as a Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (POMDP). The underlying environment state 𝑠𝑡 ∈ 𝑆 encompasses the complete browser
state at timestep 𝑡. State transitions 𝑇 : 𝑆 × 𝐴 → 𝑆 are deterministic, governed by the browser
engine executing the website’s code in response to agent actions 𝑎𝑡 ∈ 𝐴. REAL allows agents to
interact in two primary ways, allowing users to define the action space 𝐴 and the observation function
𝑂(𝑠𝑡) → 𝑜𝑡 accordingly. First, inspired by (Yao et al., 2023a; Zhou et al., 2024; Chezelles et al.,
2025), high-level interactions use Playwright, which involves an action space 𝐴 typically comprising
user-level commands (see Section 4.2) and an observation space 𝑂 (screenshots, full DOM, or the
accessibility tree) which can be configured and is explained in Section 4.1. For lower-level control,
we also provide an option for direct access to a Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) session, which
enables a near-unrestricted action space 𝐴 consisting of any valid CDP command and allows for a
richer observation space 𝑂 consisting of the entire live browser session state.
At each step 𝑡, the agent receives observation 𝑜𝑡 ∈ 𝑂, selects action 𝑎𝑡 conditioned on the task 𝑖 and
potentially the history (𝑜
𝑡
1
, 𝑎𝑡−1
1
), leading deterministically to the next state 𝑠𝑡+1 and observation 𝑜𝑡+1.
Task success (𝑟 = 1) or failure (𝑟 = 0) is determined by an outcome reward function 𝑟, evaluated
only at the final timestep 𝑇. In Section 6, we describe the agent harness and evaluation flow.
4.1. Observation Space
REAL offers configurable observation spaces 𝑂(𝑠𝑡) → 𝑜𝑡 which can be specified based on an agent’s
chosen interaction modality (high-level Playwright or low-level CDP).
For agents interacting via the high-level Playwright interface, we provide default agents that can
be configured to use an observation space 𝑂 including one or more of the following components:
Screenshots, visual renderings of the current web page; Full DOM, the complete Document Object
Model structure of the page; Accessibility Tree, a representation of the page structure based on
accessibility APIs, providing semantic information about elements. This is broadly consistent with
other web benchmarks and high-level actions existing agents use to operate (Chu et al., 2025; Putta
et al., 2024; Koh et al., 2024b; Yang et al., 2024). Alternatively, REAL provides the agent with direct
access to the Playwright Browser object itself, allowing the use of information derivable through the
Playwright API as its observation space.5
For agents requiring fine-grained control through the low-level Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP), the
observation space encompasses the entire live browser session state accessible via the CDP connection.
This provides maximum flexibility, allowing the agent to observe any aspect available as part of the
5
https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browser
7
REAL: Benchmarking Autonomous Agents on Deterministic Simulations of Real Websites
browser’s current session.6 This flexibility enables researchers to adapt the observation space to the
specific input requirements and capabilities of custom agent architectures or scaffolds.
4.2. Tasks and Action Space
Agents interact with the environment by selecting actions 𝑎𝑡 from an action space 𝐴 to accomplish
evaluation tasks detailed in Section 5. Our goal is to keep the definition of 𝐴 highly flexible (Zhang
et al., 2024b) and dependent on the chosen interaction setup.
When using the Playwright interface, the action space 𝐴 consists of high-level commands simulating
standard user inputs. This includes but is not limited to operations such as text input, manipulation
of checkboxes, mouse clicks, keyboard commands and shortcuts, file uploads, focus elements, drag
and drop, and scrolling.7 This allows agents designed around user-level actions to operate naturally
within REAL environments, though 𝐴 is not strictly limited to these examples.
Agents interfacing with environments via CDP (Chezelles et al. (2025); Drouin et al. (2024) also
incorporate rich observation spaces with CDP) have access to a substantially broader action space.
This low-level control permits a wide range of interactions directly within the browser environment.
For instance, agents can execute commands for direct Document Object Model (DOM) modification,
arbitrary JavaScript execution within the page’s context, performance profiling, emulation of different
devices or network conditions, interception and modification of network requests, and even detailed
browser session debugging using tools like breakpoints.
4.3. Rewards
Our framework primarily uses an outcome reward function 𝑟 ∈ {0, 1} to evaluate task success upon
completion (at timestep 𝑇). This binary outcome reward indicates whether the agent successfully
achieved the specified task goal 𝑖 and is determined as follows (see Section 5 for details on Action-based
and Information Retrieval tasks, similar to Zhou et al. (2024)):
• Action-based Tasks (𝑟𝐴): Rewards are determined by programmatic verification function 𝑓𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙,
which compares the difference between the initial (𝑠0) and final (𝑠𝑇 ) ‘localStorage‘ states
against a set of predefined key-value assertions specific to the task goal 𝑖. 𝑟𝐴 = 1 if and only if
all assertions pass with an exact match.
• Information Retrieval Tasks (𝑟𝑅): Rewards are determined by an LLM-judge evaluation
function 𝑔𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙, which assesses the agent’s final submitted text response against a pre-determined
task-specific rubric. 𝑟𝑅 = 1 if the response is judged as correct according to the rubric.
• Combined Tasks: Require both 𝑟𝐴 = 1 and 𝑟𝑅 = 1 for the overall task reward 𝑟 to be 1.
We note that while the current version of REAL provides binary outcome rewards, the underlying
framework components (deterministic environment, state tracking via ‘localStorage‘, programmatic
checks) are flexible enough to support the definition and use of dense, step-wise reward functions for
reinforcement learning (Lightman et al., 2023; Putta et al., 2024).
4.4. Evaluation Functions
REAL offers several endpoints for evaluations, debugging, and environment configurations:
6
https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/
7
https://playwright.dev/docs/input
8
REAL: Benchmarking Autonomous Agents on Deterministic Simulations of Real Websites
• /config: Used to initialize the environment for a specific task run. Appending query parameters
to this endpoint allows setting both universal and website-specific configurations (detailed
in Section 7), such as simulated latency, error mode flags (e.g., error_finding_driver),
accessibility settings (hide_aria_labels), and run identifiers (run_id, task_id).
• /submit: The agent must navigate to /submit to signal task completion for leaderboard submissions. This action captures the final localStorage state and the agent’s textual response. This
captured data is then used by the evaluation harness to compute the reward 𝑟 and record the
result on the public leaderboard associated with the provided run_id.
• /finish: Whenever the website state changes, those changes are saved in the website localStorage
state. Navigating to /finish at any point displays the difference between the initial state and
current state, allowing users to inspect the precise state changes.
• /clear: Navigating to /clear resets the website’s localStorage to its default empty state.
5. Evaluation Tasks
REAL consists of a suite of 112 evaluation tasks across 11 website environments. These tasks are
designed to assess performance on realistic, multi-turn interactions that mirror common user goals
and workflows encountered on the internet. These tasks go beyond simple, atomic actions and are
assigned difficulty levels (easy, medium, and hard), providing a relative indication of factors such
as amount of planning required, number of interaction steps, constraints, or the required reasoning
depth. These tasks involve both information seeking and state manipulation within the environments,
employed early on by Yao et al. (2023a); Zhou et al. (2024); Koh et al. (2024a); Yoran et al. (2024);
?. Each task is based on a natural language instruction (the ‘goal’) provided to the agent, potentially
accompanied by specific environment configurations set via the ‘/config’ endpoint (as described in
Section 7). We categorize tasks as follows.
5.1. Information Retrieval Tasks
Information Retrieval tasks require the agent to navigate an environment, locate specific pieces of
information, potentially merge findings from multiple locations, and report the result (Deng et al.,
2023; Zhou et al., 2024). The goals range in complexity from simple lookups on a single page (e.g.,
identifying the first few items listed, finding a specific flight time) to more complex queries requiring
navigation across pages or filtering based on constraints (e.g., finding the number of restaurants
matching a specific category, summarizing event counts across different calendars for a given month).
Evaluation for only retrieval tasks is based on the final text response generated by the agent upon task
completion (submitted via the ‘/submit’ endpoint). An LLM judge (Zheng et al., 2023) evaluates the
agent’s response against a predefined task-specific ‘rubric‘ to determine if the retrieved information is
accurate and complete according to the ground truth present in the environments.
5.2. Action-based Tasks
Action-based tasks require an agent to perform actions that modify the environment’s state. These
tasks represent common goal-oriented web usage, such as booking a flight or ride, scheduling calendar
events, filling out forms with specific details, professional networking, etc. These tasks often require
interpreting complex instructions involving multiple constraints (e.g., specific dates, times, locations,
passenger numbers, item types, payment details) (Yao et al., 2023a).
The evaluation of action-based tasks relies on programmatic verification of the final website stage,
captured via the browser’s ‘localStorage’ when the agent navigates to ‘/submit’. We use ‘state-check’
9
REAL: Benchmarking Autonomous Agents on Deterministic Simulations of Real Websites
mechanisms to inspect the difference between the initial and final ‘localStorage‘ state (Zhou et al.,
2024). A task is considered complete only if all specified state conditions are met. This provides an
objective and deterministic measure of the agent’s ability to effect precise state changes.
5.3. Combined Tasks and Additional Details
Several tasks within REAL combine elements of both retrieval and action (identified as ‘challengeType:
retrieval-action’). For instance, an agent might be asked to find the price of an item, add it to the cart,
complete the purchase, and then report the final cost. Furthermore, similar to Zhou et al. (2024), we
specifically include tasks designed to be impossible under the given deterministic conditions (‘possible:
false’), such as attempting to book a flight that doesn’t exist or using deliberately invalid payment
information. These tasks allow us to evaluate an agent’s ability to recognize failure conditions,
potentially utilize error recovery strategies (if applicable), and accurately report the inability to
complete the requested goal, rather than hallucinating success or failing silently (Li and Waldo, 2024;
Renze and Guven, 2024; Kara et al., 2025). Combined, our evaluations test important aspects of
agent performance and reliability in real-world scenarios.
6. Agent Harness
The REAL Agent Harness provides a standardized interface for evaluating varied agent implementations (Yao et al., 2023b; Chu et al., 2025; Putta et al., 2024; Shinn et al., 2023; Koh et al., 2024b; Yang
et al., 2024) with minimal required modification. Our goal is to prioritize simplicity and compatibility,
enabling researchers to evaluate agents across multiple interaction paradigms while maintaining
their existing agent architectures. This approach reduces the technical overhead associated with
benchmarking, promoting broader adoption and research across academia and industry.
6.1. Technical Architecture
The harness offers three integration settings to accommodate different types of agent architectures
(Acharya et al., 2025). As discussed in Section 4, direct Playwright integration grants the user access
to a Playwright Browser instance, which enables high-level control of BrowserContext and Page
objects for standard web interaction primitives (navigation, element interaction, DOM inspection).
For agents requiring lower-level control, the harness provides a WebSocket endpoint for the Chrome
DevTools Protocol (CDP), which allows direct execution of CDP commands across domains like DOM,
Runtime, Network, and Input for fine-grained state manipulation. Third, for agents employing blackbox systems, our harness supports integration via URL endpoints that expose the browser instance,
allowing external controllers to attach and manage the session.
6.2. Evaluation Flow
A task is initialized when the harness receives a task definition, including a natural language goal (𝑖)
and a configuration URL. The harness launches and manages a dedicated browser instance, navigating
it to the specified /config endpoint (Section 4.4). Subsequently, control is passed to the agent via its
selected integration setting and the agent then enters an iterative loop, receiving observations 𝑜𝑡 and
executing actions 𝑎𝑡 which get translated to corresponding API calls (e.g., page.click(), page.evaluate(),
or Input.dispatchKeyEvent via CDP). This interaction cycle continues until the agent attempts to fulfill
the task goal 𝑖, potentially constrained by a maximum step limit. Task completion is signaled by the
agent navigating to the designated /submit endpoint or just returning an output/ending the loop
(for local client-side evaluation). The harness intercepts this final step, and captures two primary
10
REAL: Benchmarking Autonomous Agents on Deterministic Simulations of Real Websites
details: the final localStorage state and any agent generated text response (optional), passed via the
URL query string. These are then programmatically passed to the task-specific evaluation (outcome
reward) functions we describe in Section 5.
6.3. Submissions and Leaderboard API
Our evaluation framework operates in two modes. A local evaluation returns results directly, allowing
quick iterative development and debugging. Researchers can also use the /finish endpoint during
these runs to inspect the intermediate localStorage state-diff without concluding the evaluation.
Alternatively, navigating to /submit with the correct id can be used for a formal leaderboard submission
attempt. This initiates a full evaluation for potential inclusion in public rankings, subject to manual
verification. This supports both private research and verified public benchmarking, similar to Zhou
et al. (2024); Yoran et al. (2024); Drouin et al. (2024); Wang et al. (2025).
6.4. Integration of Custom Agents
The REAL harness is designed as an adapter layer to minimize the effort required to integrate custom
agents. Researchers can connect their existing systems, including those with proprietary reasoning or
planning modules, by implementing the interaction logic against just one of the provided interfaces
(Playwright API, CDP command execution, or external control via URL access). This significantly
reduces the need for agent-side architectural modifications, lowering the barrier to participation for
academic and commercial teams while enabling standardized benchmarking.
7. Configurable Environments
REAL incorporates a configuration framework that enables precise control over testing conditions,
significantly improving its utility for rigorous agent evaluations. Addressing limitations of static
environments found in prior benchmarks (Yao et al., 2023a; Zhou et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023)
and the non-reproducibility of live websites (Kapoor et al., 2024), REAL implements a two-level
configuration system—universal and website-specific. This structure supports systematic evaluations
to develop reliable agents (Chezelles et al., 2025; Drouin et al., 2024), while maintaining the
determinism crucial for reproducible results. Configurations are applied for each task run via standard
query string parameters appended to a dedicated /config endpoint on each website.
Universal configurations apply globally across all websites within the benchmark, and are used to
establish consistent baseline conditions. Parameters at this level include settings such as simulated
network latency (default 2000ms), the hide_aria_labels flag (default false) to control the presence
of ARIA attributes for accessibility testing, and identifiers for experimental management (run_id,
task_id). Configuring these parameters allows researchers to isolate and understand the effects of
broader web/browser based factors on agent behavior across tasks and websites (Kapoor et al., 2024).
Website-specific configurations allow granular control over the internal state, behavior, and simulated
backend processes tailored to each individual application. This capability is essential for simulating
specific operational scenarios, user contexts, and edge cases related to each site. Beyond initializing
basic states, for example the total_conversations on GoMail, these parameters provide detailed
control relevant to real-world usage (Krishnan, 2025; Xu et al., 2024). Here, we use the UDriver
environment as an illustration of the website-specific parameters researchers can configure:
• Introduce controlled error states into workflows to evaluate agent error detection and recovery
capabilities (e.g., setting error_finding_driver=true or error_booking_ride=true).
11
REAL: Benchmarking Autonomous Agents on Deterministic Simulations of Real Websites
• Modify the timing or latency of operations to assess agents under different system response
times (e.g., adjusting simulating_searching_driver_delay or simulating_booking_trip durations).
• Modify application-specific logic parameters, such as internal pricing calculations or discount
availability (e.g., modifying udriverx_multiplier or comfort_discount).
• Set initial content or regional contexts via data presets (e.g., using location_preset=2 to
initialize the environment with data relevant to New York).
This fine-grained control enables targeted evaluations focused on how agents handle specific website
behaviors or data conditions. Detailed configurations for each environment part of REAL are provided
on our website8
.
This dual-level configuration system in REAL provides researchers an extensive amount of control
over specific experimental variables within a deterministic framework. This allows for a systematic
evaluation of agent reliability across several general and task/website specific modifications (Xia
et al., 2025). The ability to precisely define, reproduce, and study such conditions allows for research
that is often infeasible on live, dynamic websites or less flexible benchmark environments.

Experimental at 38.39%. Similarly, other reasoning models also perform much better than standard
pre-trained models, for example o3 (34.82%), o3-mini (25.00%), and o1 (16.07%)
10. Despite this,
there is a significant room for improvement. Open source models currently lag behind, with Llama-4-
Maverick (12.50%) showing effectively similar performance to Llama 3.3 70B (10.71%) (Grattafiori
et al., 2024). This suggests that increases in scale alone, at least between these specific models, did
not translate into improved practical web navigation capabilities. Notably, DeepSeek V3 (19.64%)
(DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) show much better performance than Llama models. Small models lag
significantly, with Llama-3.1-8B, Qwen-2.5-vl-32B, and Gemma-3-27B achieving only 1.79%, 2.68%,
and 9.82% respectively, underscoring the requirement for substantial model capacity and training to
handle the complexities of agentic performance. We also evaluated OpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent
(CUA) model (Chu et al., 2025), recording a success rate of only 7.14%. When these trajectories were
manually examined, we observed that CUA was frequently distracted by irrelevant details and did
not complete the final steps of several tasks.
Overall, our results demonstrate that reliable, autonomous navigation of websites and completion of
tasks remains a significant challenge for current frontier models. Similar results are also observed
across benchmarks, as studied by Chezelles et al. (2025). We do expect performance to go up with
better agent scaffolds beyond our baseline, that integrate search and post-training similar to Putta
et al. (2024); Koh et al. (2024b); Su et al. (2025). REAL is flexible enough to develop harder tasks on
the same environments if agents saturate the current test-set in the short term.

8.1. Qualitative Observations
We analyze interaction traces and outline two common failure modes contributing to low performance
of models with the baseline agent on our benchmark.
Inadequate Failure Recognition and State Verification Agents often fail to assess whether they
have successfully completed all parts of the task, lending more weight to their perceived previous
10https://cdn.openai.com/o1-system-card-20240917.pdf
13
REAL: Benchmarking Autonomous Agents on Deterministic Simulations of Real Websites
actions than the actual updated observation space. For example, within Omnizon (e-commerce),
an agent tasked with adding two items to the cart might add the first item but then fail to add the
second item due to clicking an incorrect button or misinterpreting the page state. Despite the cart
only containing one item, the agent proceeds through checkout, concluding the interaction under the
false assumption that the task was complete. Immediate state-verification against the overall goal and
error direction thus remain challenging, as also observed in Zhou et al. (2024); Li and Waldo (2024).
Navigation Dead Ends and Lack of Recovery Agents often struggle when encountering non-standard
navigation flows or unexpected states, and lack the intuitions to backtrack effectively. For example, in
the Udriver ride-booking environment, an agent might correctly initiate a booking but then click on
an option to schedule the ride for a future time, entering a sub-menu. Once in this sub-environment,
agents frequently fail to identify the correct UI element (e.g. a back button, cancel option, or the
intended next step) to return to the primary task. Interpreting and understanding the purpose of UI
elements to apply reliable exploration or backtracking strategies remains an issue, and agents enter
loops of clicking irrelevant elements, effectively getting stuck.
9. Discussion and Future Work
In this work, we introduced REAL, a benchmark and framework designed to evaluate and improve the
accuracy and reliability of autonomous web agents. By providing 11 high-fidelity, deterministic web
environments along with 112 realistic multi-turn tasks, REAL offers important improvements over prior
benchmarks (Yao et al., 2023a; Zhou et al., 2024; Chezelles et al., 2025). Furthermore, the flexible
agent harness, supporting both high-level (Playwright) and low-level (CDP) interaction for open and
proprietary systems, alongside publicly hosted environments and a leaderboard, lowers the barrier to
entry and facilitates standardized, comparative research. Our findings on the benchmark show the
challenges posed by realistic environments and highlights the substantial room for improvement in
agent capabilities on consequential web tasks (Li and Waldo, 2024).
Beyond its primary role as an evaluation benchmark, REAL is designed to serve as a valuable environment for data generation and agent post-training (Shinn et al., 2023; Putta et al., 2024; Zhou
et al., 2025). The deterministic nature of our environments and detailed state information (especially
precise state changes resulting from actions as well as a rich observation space via complete CDP
session access), and well defined outcome reward functions allow for the collection of interaction
trajectories suitable for various post-training approaches, including imitation learning (Zelikman
et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023) and reinforcement learning (Schulman et al., 2017; Putta et al.,
2024; Qi et al., 2025). Researchers can readily extend the benchmark by defining new tasks with
custom goals and evaluation metrics tailored to specific training objectives. The depth and complexity
of our websites and tasks makes REAL particularly relevant for advancing RL techniques aimed at
improving the reasoning and planning capabilities (Xiang et al., 2025; Jaech et al., 2024) of web
agents. While REAL is currently limited to only outcome rewards and a small suite of evaluation
tasks, future iterations will include a dedicated library (Brockman et al., 2016) and set of training
tasks to streamline RL post-training workflows (Kumar et al., 2025; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025). The
framework is flexible enough to allow the use of advanced planning (Gu et al., 2025), multi-agent
(Motwani et al., 2025), or tree-search methods (Koh et al., 2024b); future work will also focus on
providing improved integration support for such search-based agent architectures.
REAL is designed for extensibility, and the task suite can be expanded with scenarios requiring more
sophisticated long horizon reasoning (Chen et al., 2025) or cross-application workflows (Drouin et al.,
2024; Bonatti et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024) as agents improve. We acknowledge current limitations,
including the finite set of 11 environments and the focus specifically on web-based interactions,
14

which represent only a subset of potential agent applications. However, REAL delivers an important,
rigorous, and accessible framework designed to bridge the gap between current research and practical
deployment. Our goal is to drive the development of autonomous agents (Putta et al., 2024), and
REAL provides the benchmark and framework necessary to evaluate and train these systems to
improve their capability and reliability for important real-world applications.
